What's in the ntop distribution ?
---------------------------------

1) ntop                 [. directory]
This is the classic ntop application that runs only in web mode.

2) intop                [intop/ directory]
This is the interactive ntop application. it allows you to play with ntop from a text mode terminal.
Unsupported. While the minimal changes have been made so that it compiles (2.0.99) and starts up...
intop really needs somebody to take over and give it the TLC it needs.  Otherwise, IMHO (Burton) it should be in /obsolete 

3) www
How to extract data out of ntop using Perl/PHP

4) docs
All the documentation that's fit to print! Please help us out and write more!

5) plugins
ntop add ons, such as sflow, pda, etc.

6) utils
Little pieces of code that might be useful.

7) obsolete
Unsupported, saved here for reference, or if somebody wanted
to resurect them.

8) packages
Files used to build executable packages for MacOSX, RedHat and Suse environments.
More a starting point than a finished output, due to tool differences, file layouts,
etc.

9) database
Definition files for mySQL and postgres databases.


Have fun!
