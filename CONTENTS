What's in the ntop distribution ?
---------------------------------

1) ntop                 [. directory]
This is the classic ntop application that runs only in web mode.

2) intop                [intop/ directory]
This is the interactive ntop application. it allows you to play with ntop from a text mode terminal.

3) remoteInterfaceAPI   [remoteInterfaceAPI/ directory]
It contains the API (written in C++ and Perl) for accessing ntop from remote. In this way you can write lightweight clients, CGIs etc. that talk to ntop without having to link any ntop library.

4) NtoPerl              [NtoPerl directory]
A work in progress implementation of ntop in Perl. Not yet ready.



Have fun!
