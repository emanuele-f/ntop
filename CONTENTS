What's in the ntop distribution ?
---------------------------------

1) ntop                 [. directory]
This is the classic ntop application that runs only in web mode.

2) intop                [intop/ directory]
This is the interactive ntop application. It allows you to play with ntop from
a text mode terminal instead of a web browser.  While the minimal changes have
again been made so that it compiles and starts up... as of ntop v2.2 this remains
unsupported.  Rocco has indicated he may be able to devote time to this going forward.

3) www
How to extract data out of ntop using Perl/PHP/Python

4) docs
All the documentation that's fit to print! Please help us out and write more!

5) plugins
ntop add ons, such as sflow, pda, etc.

6) utils
Little pieces of code that might be useful or are used in the preparation
of data files and such.

7) obsolete
Unsupported, saved here for reference, or if somebody wanted to resurect them.

8) packages
Files used to build executable packages for MacOSX, RedHat and Suse environments.
More a starting point than a finished output, due to tool differences, file layouts,
etc.

   NOTE: The 'RedHat' files are older and NOT the ones used to create the
         .rpm files posted at SourceForge.

9)  html
html files used by ntop, includes images

10) installer
Files used to build executable packages for MacOSX.

11) NetFlow
(Old) A simple NetFlow collector that stores in a MySQL DB all the traffic information 
sent by a NetFlow probe such as ntop.




Have fun!
