ntop is distributed under GPL2. However, if you like and use ntop, we would appreciate
a small donation to the project using the follwing URL:

http://order.kagi.com/cgi-bin/register1.cgi?UXH

This is necessary because we get no founding at all from the University so I have to purchase
personally books, hardware and software for better developing ntop and improving ntop.

Thanks for supporting ntop!

Cheers, Luca.
