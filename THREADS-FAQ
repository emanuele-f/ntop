  THREADS-FAQ
  ===========

HP-UX
Q: Why the HP-UX version of ntop isn't multithreaded?
A: Because HP's pthread implementation is slightly different that
   the standard one and I don't wanna have too many code versions
   of ntop just to be compatible with non-standard OSs.

IRIX
Q. Where can I find pthreads for IRIX 6.2?
A. Irix 6.2 doesn't support POSIX threads out of of the box. You must 
   install the patche: 2791

Q: Why the IRIX version of ntop doesn't use semaphores although 
   they are implemented in the OS?
A: I have IRIX 6.2 and uder this OS relase semaphores seem to have
   some problems. This is a implementation issue only because ntop
   supports threads under IRIX.
