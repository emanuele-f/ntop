Quick Instructions
==================

1. Get and install mandatory packages/tools

      These instructions assume your system is already provided with
      the normal source compile tools.  Most are gnu packages, available 
      through http://www.gnu.org or your favorite prebuilt package source.

      Using their RedHat package names, these are:

         - glibc, glibc-devel, gcc, cpp
         - gawk
         - autoconf, automake
         - openssl, openssl-devel (http://www.openssl.org)
         - gdbm, gdbm-devel
         - libpcap (http://www.tcpdump.org)

      Also, one additional package, which used only for intop:

         - ncurses


2. Build chart libraries

   - cd gdchart0.94c/
   - ./configure
   - cd gd-1.8.3/libpng-1.2.4
   - cp scripts/makefile.[make your choice] Makefile
   - make
   - cd ../../zlib-1.1.4/
   - ./configure
   - make
   - cd ..
   - make

   If you're using a gcc-powered system you can type
   - cd gdchart0.94c/
   - ./buildAll.sh

   Note: It MAY be necessary for some of these packages on some systems
         to do a "make install".  If you get error messages concerning 
         missing libraries at run time, then try doing the make install 
         from the appropriate subdirectory.

3. Build ntop

   - cd ntop
   - ./configure
   - make
   - make install

4. Run ntop (See 1STRUN.txt)

   - /usr/local/bin/ntop -A -u userid -P directory

          where  userid is the *nix userid you've created - with minimal
                 permissions - to run ntop
                 directory is the directory path where ntop will store
                 it's databases

   - /usr/local/bin/ntop -u userid -P directory ...other parameters...

Note: Following these instructions builds static linked versions of
      required libraries (gdchart, gd, libpng and libz), so that
      ntop doesn't care about other versions installed on your system.
      It may not be optimal, but it will get you started.

      The problem is that across the universe of *nix systems, libraries
      get installed in many different locations, making the Makefile
      incredibly complex. 

      What really needs to happen is that the makefiles need to search 
      for AND USE the .a static libraries if they exist, otherwise, 
      search for and use .so (shared) libraries - and to do so looking 
      in all the usual places (/usr /usr/local /opt etc.).  This change
      will NOT be part of ntop 2.1.

      The following patch to configure.in will change ./configure's
      behavior to look for .so libraries in the location you define
      via --with-gdchart-root=/usr or --with-gdchart-root=/usr/local
      (or whatever is appropriate to your situation).

      Note the limitations of this patch - it still doesn't handle 
      libpng (beyond assuming it's in the /etc/ld.so.conf locations as 
      a .so or in gd-1.8.3/libpng-1.2.4), etc.

      This patch is NOT supported or guaranteed, use it as a starting point
      for your unique situation.  It's been MINIMALLY tested on RedHat Linux,
      but not under Solaris or other *nixes.
