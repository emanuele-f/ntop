Quick Instructions
==================

1. Get and install mandatory packages/tools

      These instructions assume your system is already provided with
      the normal source compile tools.  Most are gnu packages, available 
      through http://www.gnu.org or your favorite prebuilt package source.

      Using their RedHat package names, these are:

         - glibc, glibc-devel, gcc, cpp
         - gawk
         - autoconf (2.51+), automake (1.5+), libtool (1.4+)
         - openssl, openssl-devel (http://www.openssl.org)
         - gdbm, gdbm-devel
         - libpcap (http://www.tcpdump.org)

      Also, one additional package, which used only for intop:

         - ncurses


2. Build chart libraries

   - cd gdchart0.94c/
   - ./configure
   - cd gd-1.8.3/libpng-1.2.4
   - cp scripts/makefile.[make your choice] Makefile
   - make
   - cd ../../zlib-1.1.4/
   - ./configure
   - make
   - cd ..
   - make

   If you're using a gcc-powered system you can type
   - cd gdchart0.94c/
   - ./buildAll.sh

   Note: It MAY be necessary for some of these packages on some systems
         to do a "make install".  If you get error messages concerning 
         missing libraries at run time, then try doing the make install 
         from the appropriate subdirectory.

3. Build ntop

   - cd ntop
   - ./configure
   - make
   - make install

4. Run ntop (See 1STRUN.txt)

   - /usr/local/bin/ntop -A -u userid -P directory

          where  userid is the *nix userid you've created - with minimal
                 permissions - to run ntop
                 directory is the directory path where ntop will store
                 it's databases

   - /usr/local/bin/ntop -u userid -P directory ...other parameters...

Note: Following these instructions builds static linked versions of
      required libraries (gdchart, gd, libpng and libz).  If other versions
      are already installed, you'll see messages in the ./configure output.

      The problem is that across the universe of *nix systems, libraries
      get installed in many different locations, making the Makefile
      incredibly complex.  If ntop can't find things, you will have to
      explicitly tell ./configure where to find them via a series of
      --with-xxxx-root=dir parameters.
