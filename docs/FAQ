Section 1 - All Platforms
=========================

Q. What is ntop?
A. ntop is an open source network top - the official website can be found at
   http://www.ntop.org/

Q. Is ntop like mrtg.
A. No & Yes...

   ntop isn't a snmp enabled monitor like mrtg.

   ntop is rather a traffic monitor with it's own interfaces, which monitors
   what it sees.

   ntop also supports netFlow (Cisco) and sFlow, which allow external monitors 
   to send information to an ntop instance.

Q. Why isn't there (any)(more)(better) documentation.
A. (A personal peeve from Burton...)

   I get real tired of people complaining that there isn't any documentation
   and then being unwilling to contribute even the simplest stuff.  I've said
   I'll edit and assemble whatever people send me... and since I started working
   with ntop in November 2001, I've received maybe two pages of stuff.

   I'm trying to get people - who aren't coders - to contribute to ntop the project.
   The contribution that ANYONE can make is "documentation".  A task-specific
   HOWTO... some sample screen shots... An FAQ entry...

   I've tried being nice.
   I've tried asking.
   I've tried shaming people into it.  

   What have I gotten?    Zip.

   Nasty is all that's left...  This is your fair warning.  If you show up on 
   the ntop mailing lists and complain about documentation, you will get blasted.

Compiling
---------
 
Q. ntop doesn't compile.
A. First, check the output from ./configure for an error message - sometimes
   people miss them.  Then review the output from make, also looking for an error.
   Finally, look at config.log Look in config.log to see what ./configure found 
   when looking for headers and libraries.  Usually, you are missing a critical
   library, but tried to "make" anyway after ./configure failed.

   Hint: It may sometimes be that you're missing the header files (often those 
   are in a -devel rpm if you're running RedHat)


Q. What is "snapshot"
A. Snapshot is a community FAQ and documentation resource at http://snapshot.ntop.org.
   It's also the site of "the snapshots".


Q. What is "a snapshot" or "the snapshots"?
A. A snapshot is a dump of the ntop cvs structure, automatically generated every
   day at 5 minutes after midnight (Pisa time). 

   Snapshots are named with their creation date, in the form of ntop-yy-mm-dd.tgz. 

   Snapshots are not polished nor even "releases". They contain any update(s) 
   checked into the cvs during the prior day.  No more, no less.
   
   cvs checkins (commits) are usually tested by the developer, but perhaps only in
   one (limited) environment.  Occasionally a file is missed or a typo occurs and a 
   snapshot won't compile. Snapshots frequently introduce bugs that aren't apparent 
   on a quick review.  Snapshots are basically a point-in-time capture of the
   moving development environment.  No more and no less.

   With release 2.0, rapid development occurred after general release and using 
   the latest snapshot was your best bet. With 2.1 we hope to be a little more
   stable and to release incremental versions (e.g. 2.1a) if necessary.
   
   If the 2.1 release doesn't work, drop by the mailing lists and check the back
   traffic to see if this is a common problem.  If it's not, try the latest 
   snapshot or ask for a recommendation of which version is the best to use.  


Q. I have a problem with...
A. Please run ./autogen.sh -1 and try again.
   ntop is distributed with generated files from RedHat 7.2 and/or Solaris 8
   systems.  The Makefile is supposed to detect things being out of whack and
   automatically regenerate these files, but it doesn't ALWAYS work.

   Doing ./autogen.sh -1 makes the various generated files conform to your
   system and your tools versions.  It's the right thing to do.

Q: How do I force configure to build ntop without xxxx support?
A: ./configure --help shows a bunch of configuration options available to you:

      --enable-micro-ntop     compile a slim version of ntop 
                              [default=disabled]
      --disable-mt            disable multithread support also if available 
                              [default=enabled]
      --enable-mysql          enable MySQL support also if available 
                              [default=disabled]
      --disable-ssl           disable HTPPS support also if OpenSSL is 
                              available [default=enabled]
      --disable-readline      disable GNU readline support also if available
                              [default=enabled]
      --disable-curses        disable curses support also if available
                              [default=enabled]
      --disable-gdchart       disable GDChart support also if available
                              [default=enabled]
      --enable-tcpwrap        enable TCP Wrap support if available 
                              [default=disabled]
      --enable-ignoresigpipe  Ignore SIGPIPE errors [default=do not ignore]
      --enable-sslwatchdog    Watchdog for ssl hangups (Netscape 6.2.2)
                              [default=disabled]
      --enable-sslv3          enable ssl v3 support if available
                              [default=disabled]
      +----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
      --disable-plugins       disable compilation of plugins, also if they are 
                              available [default=disabled]
      --disable-intop         disable compilation of intop [default=enabled]


Q. Which packages/libraries do I need to compile ntop:
       glibc
       gcc
       cpp
       gawk
       autoconf
       automake
       openssl (for https:// support)
       gdbm
       libpcap
       mysql (for mySQL support)

     Note that in some cases the minimal header files for a tool will be in one
	      "package" and the execution library in another. ntop needs both so that
	      the ./configure test finds the tool. It's usually safest to install both 
	      the tool and development packages!

	 (Note some packages will have additional packages as pre-requisites)
	 
     Building libpcap requires: bison/flex  

Q. Compile dies because it's missing depcomp
A. automake/autoconf issue.  Just copy the missing file (or make a symbolic link) into
   the ntop source directory.
   
   It's in /usr/share/automake on my Linux boxes 
   Another user reports it is in /usr/local/share/automake in sun8. 

   Snapshots after February 2002 should have fixed the problem, but you may have
   to run ./autogen.sh -1 to create the pointer.

Q. How do I update the Vendor Table (MAC address prefixes)?
A. ntop has (in Makefile), a rule to automatically download the latest vendor 
   information table from the IEEE and a rule to rebuild the vendor table 
   (vendortable.h). 

   If you are seeing unknown MAC address prefixes (the 1st three units), try 
   and rebuild it:

     > mkdir Internet 
     > make dnvt 
     > make vt 

    You will then need to recompile ntop! 

    It does change - there are almost 600 modifications and/or new assigments between
    the February 2002 version and the one in ntop 2.0.


Q. I get an error, libtool: link: CURRENT `-release' is not a nonnegative integer
A. This is an autoconf problem.  The whole set of messages is typically:

   [...]
   > libtool: link: CURRENT `-release' is not a nonnegative integer
   > libtool: link: `-release' is not valid version information
   > make[2]: *** [libntop.la] Error 1
   > make[2]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/ntop'
   > make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
   > make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/ntop'
   > make: *** [all-recursive-am] Error 2

   From Luca: 

       "AFAIK this is a bug of autoconf that's not able to expand some macros, 
        namely those that contain the version number. The workaround is to 
        downgrade to the previous autoconf version." 

       Workarounds:
       - downgrade to a stable autoconf version
       - edit all the ntop Makefile(s), add "0:0:0" behind any 
         occurence of "version-info" and "2.0" behind
         "-release".


   Other Solutions: 

   1) Burton posted a personal patch to do the above for Makefile.am on
      Thu Dec 20 2001 - "Compile problems with -release". Check the ntop-dev archive. 

   2) Older versions (e.g. Slackware 7.xx) of Linux installations have older versions 
      of automake, which don't exhibit the bug. 

   3) (Sean O'Neill) "I cheated a bit and hacked libtool by changing the following" 

        current="$2" 
          to 
        current=0 


Q. Why do we have static linked libraries in buildAll.sh?
A. I (Burton) don't know the history, but I have some guesses...  First the facts...

   gdchart0.94c wasn't regularly released - it's a special release for ntop -
   check the home page and there isn't a mention of c!

   libpng-1.0.8 has different calling parameters vs. 1.2.x and DOES NOT
   implement the typical backwards compatible entry points.  So if you compile
   with one and .so to the other, it breaks...  nice, huh?

   zlib?  Probably wouldn't have been an issue, but - as everyone else got
   bitten by - it had been so stable for so long, that nobody even thought
   about it...

   My guess is that it simply became easier for Luca - static linking kills 
   off a whole raft of problem reports.  But that's only a guess - I wasn't
   involved with ntop back then...

   Could it be fixed/changed??  Sure.  Volunteers are welcome.


Q. What is "obsolete/"
A. Obsolete code is code that is no longer being maintained nor part of ntop, but
   it's stuck off in that directory because 1) storage is cheap and 2) it might have
   usage someday and 3) somebody might be interested in resurecting it...

   Code in obsolete/ IS NOT MAINTAINED, even minimally. 

   Specifics?  (As of June 2002)

       Various programs and functions which supported "rules" were determined to be
       obsolete were removed from ntop in late March 2002. This included a substantial
       number of lines of code which was simply removed. Entire modules were placed into 
       the obsolete/ directory. 
               ntop-rules.8 
               event.c 
               rules.c 
               rules.h 
               rules.sample 

       Various plugin programs which were no longer being supported were removed from 
       ntop in late March 2002. These entire modules were placed into the obsolete/ 
       directory. 
               wapPlugin.c 
               rmon.h 
               rmonPlugin.c  

       Various lines of code (totaling a substantial number, widely scattered throughout 
       ntop), which had provided compile-time selectable support (#define ENABLE_NAPSTER) 
       for analysis of the (late) Napster protocol were removed on 4Apr2002.  


Q, How to Build the (obsolete) RMON plugin
A. Without any guarantees...

    0) Please do NOT use a precompiled UCD package unless you know what you're doing. 

    1) Fetch UCD-SNMP [See http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/developer.html] 

    2) Compile the stuff as specified as follows : 
        [see also http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/tutorial/toolkit/demon/] 
    > ./configure --with-mib-modules="agentx" 
    > make 
    > make install 

    3) Once you this stuff ready you can build the ntop/RMON plugins. 

    4) Now start ntop. 

    5) The ntop/RMON plugin listens on port 161 (the default SNMP port). 
        If you want to test the agent you can use the 'tkMib' tool that comes with 
        UCD-SNMP [see http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/tkmib.jpg]. 

   NOTE: If you use tkMib do not forget to do "setenv MIBS ALL" (csh shells), 
         otherwise you won't see the RMON MIB.  

   How to Build the RMON plugin (bis) created 04/03 2002 by pierlo  
   
   The following works with : 
     - ntop v.2.0.1 
     - UCD-SNMP v.4.2.3 
     - openSSL v.0.9.6c 

     0. Requirements 
     * Make sure that ntop works properly 

     * Make sure that openSSL & openSSL libraries are correctly installed
       (no WARNING when ntop is started !). If not, download and install 
       the latest versions) 

     * fetch & install UCD-SNMP : 
     tar -xvzf XXXXX.tar.gz 
     ./configure --enable-shared 
     make 
     umask 022 
     make install 

     1. uncomment lines around 474 and 1035 in configure.in file : 

     dnl>OPTIONAL UCD-SNMP 
     dnl>AC_HAVE_HEADERS(ucd-snmp/ucd-snmp-agent-includes.h) 
     (...) 
     dnl> check for `UCD-SNMP' library by University of California [http://ucd-snmp.ucdavis.edu] 
     dnl>AC_CHECK_LIB(ucdagent, register_mib, [AC_DEFINE(HAVE_SNMP) SNMPLIBS="-L/usr/local/lib -lsnmp -lucdagent -lucdmibs"], , -lsnmp -lucdagent -lucdmibs $LIBS $MORELIBS) 

     (remove the dnl> from the AC_ lines) 

     * in /ntop/plugins/rmonPlugin.c file, replace : 

     line 702 approx. : droppedPackets with droppedPkts 
     (there is only one occurence, so it may not be difficult to find) 

     line 676 approx. : 
     if (header_simple_table (vp,name,length,exact,var_len, 
          write_method,numDevices) 

     with : 

     if (header_simple_table(vp,name,length,exact,var_len, 
          write_method,myGlobals.numDevices) 

     and : 

     long_ret = (long)(device[ifNum] 

     with 

     long_ret = (long)(myGlobals.device[ifNum] 

     (lines 690 to 782 approx., about 13 occurences to change) 

     2. launch /ntop/autogen.sh -1 

     3. launch /ntop/configure 

     Be sure that : 

     * there is no warning about openSSL libraries ! 

     * the following checks are successful : 
     " Step 4. Looking for both required and optional system headers.... 
     (...) 
     checking for ucd-snmp/ucd-snmp-agent-includes.h... yes" 
     (...) 
     
     "Step 7. Looking for optional GPLed libraries.... 
     (...) 
     checking for register_mib in -lucdagent... yes" 

     -> NO warning about openSSL libraries here ! If any trouble, 
     check config.log file, which may help to get round the problem... 
     Looking at ls.so.conf file and checking libraries pathes may also be helpful. 

     3. edit /ntop/plugins/Makefile : replace every ocurence of "icmpPlugin" with "rmonPlugin". 

     4. Launch /ntop/plugins/make 

     5. Theoretically, RMON plugin is built and is ready to work ! If you have 
        a error message like "undefined symbol..." when ntop started... 
        I don't know how to fix it. 

     Hope I didn't forget anything... Have fun ! 

     P-L.  
 

Running
-------

Q. What is the function of the 'ntop' script in the build directory - should I
   call it or /usr/local/bin/ntop ?
A. (from the comments in the script):

    # ntop - temporary wrapper script for .libs/ntop
    # Generated by ltmain.sh - GNU libtool 1.4 (1.920 2001/04/24 23:26:18)
    #
    # The ntop program cannot be directly executed until all the libtool
    # libraries that it depends on are installed.
    #
    # This wrapper script should never be moved out of the build directory.
    # If it is, it will not operate correctly.
    
   It allows you to run ntop out of the build directory before doing a "make
   install" by doing all the necessary linkage magic - such as forcing a relink
   if it didn't succeed originally - to the files in .libs.

   Think of it as simulating make install, but not moving stuff to /usr/local
   or wherever.


Q. Which libraries do I need?
A. To run ntop: glibc, gdbm, libpcap 
      For https://, add openssl. 
      For intop, add ncurses. 
      For other tools and compile options, add the appropriate libraries. 


Q. ntop seems to run, but the web server isn't up.
A. Set the password - see docs/1STRUN.TXT


Q. How do you reset Admin password if we lost it?
A. Delete ntop_pw.db and follow the procedure in docs/1STRUN.txt


Q. ntop seems to run but I don't see any traffic.
A. Make sure you aren't running against the loopback (127.0.0.1) interface.
   lo shouldn't see much traffic, only that originating on the host destined
   for it (e.g. ping 127.0.0.1).


Q. ntop is unable to open it's database file.  Specifically:
   I have following messages while running ntop

     wait please: ntop is coming up...
     24/Jul/2003 15:15:23 Initializing IP services...
     <snip />
     24/Jul/2003 15:15:23 Initializing GDBM...
     24/Jul/2003 15:15:23 Database '/var/ntop/addressCache.db' open failed: File open error
     24/Jul/2003 15:15:23 Possible solution: please use '-P <directory>'
A. Multiple possible choices...
    1. The directory /var/ntop doesn't exist.  Create it or, as the message says, use the
       -P parameter to point ntop at another directory.
    2. You many not have read/write rights in /var/ntop - if you're running in non-promiscuous
       mode from a user other than root.
    3. Another instance of ntop may already be running, so it has the file open and locked.
   (Added 29Jul2002 by Burton)


Q. ntop stops capturing packets, except ARP and other broadcasts.  Why?
A. Check if you have a daemon running that periodically checks for and 
   resets interfaces in promiscuous mode?  If that happens, all you 
   would see were broadcast packets like ARPs...

   Check back in the log and see if there is a message about the interface
   changing status.  Determine why.


Q. How much horsepower do I need to run ntop on a network of size x?
A. Nobody really knows.  ntop needs enough memory to store the active
   hosts and enough cpu to keep up with the average packet flow.  The
   buffer will handle the occasional peak, but if you see frequent
   lost packets, you're in trouble.

   Note that a few packets occasionally lost isn't a big deal for most 
   users.  After all, the network itself has losses - I've seen my AT&T
   Broadband connection have spurts of 30% packet loss.  Ideally in a 
   LAN environment, the packet loss should be down in the small #s... 
   the Ethernet standard allows 1  error in 100,000,000(10^8), but most 
   vendors beat that by a long margin (even as high as 1 in 10^12).

   Of course, those are lab measurements.  In the real world?  Not that good.
   Electrical noise can be a real bugaboo. Remember, at a certain point, if 
   the nic doesn't understand what it's seeing, it throws it away and 
   declares an error.  The key is to keep up with the traffic.

   Similarly, the OS kernel does the same thing in it's interrupt handling
   (throw away packets).  Last resort, but better than hanging up the whole
   machine.

   ntop drops packets when the queue gets longer than the permitted length.
   You can see this in the configuration page as # Queued Pkts to Process 
   and # Max Queued Pkts.

   One or two or a small number (you pick your tollerance) is ok, but constant 
   losses isn't.  What I'm saying is that as long as ntop can keep up with the 
   nic, then the data is as good as it gets...  if ntop can't keep up, then the 
   data isn't very good.

   If you have measurements - network size, traffic flow and %CPU used (with
   the hardware info, of course), shoot them over to us on ntop and someday
   maybe we'll be able to give better #s.


Q. ntop starts up with this:
   WARNING: Discarded network 172.20.0.0/16: this is the local network.
A. No worries.  The message means exactly what it says - it's a warning that 
   you gave the local network as one of the parameter(s) to -m.  Since the 
   local networks are always local, ntop doesn't need to make them pseudo-local.


Q. Can I set the admin password from a script?
A. Yes, you can call ntop with the option: 
      ntop --set-admin-password=password 	  

   If you are really crazy, emulate a tty with ptty, in a python script posted at
   Snapshot.


Q. I changed the owner of the ntop database directory to the user
   ntop runs as and I get prompted for the password endlessly.
A. Don't.  At the point in the code where databases are opened, ntop has not yet
   shed privileges.  So the databases must be owned by root.  Sensitive info,
   such as the ntop "admin" password are stored in there, so changing ownership
   isn't a good idea.


Q. Can I disable logging? Totally?
A. Sort of - if you run single threaded, without the -d or -L options.
   Multithreaded?  No.  If ntop creates child threads, they don't have 
   terminal access and have to have some way of reporting things.


Q. I can't merge interfaces (-M option)?
A. Check your plugins and see if either netflow or sflow is active.
   Regardless of whether you're using them, if they're active, they 
   (silently) force the -M switch on.


Q. I'm seeing weird "hosts" on my network with names like	"Bridge Sp. Tree/OSI Route".
   What are they?
A. There is a list of "special" MAC address prefixes in vendor.c, specialMacInfo[].
   There are blocks of MAC addresses reserved (sometimes not formally) for special
   uses, such as sharing information about Spanning Tree for bridges.  These do not
   have an IP address - they operate at a lower level - so nothing gets displayed
   in some of ntop's fields.

   A reference about protocols at the wire level is here:
      http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2001/03/02/net_2nd_lang.html

   If you only want to see TCP/IP, then I suggest you use -B "ip" to filter
   only TCP/IP protocol on your ntop line...


Q. How do I see fully qualified names for all my hosts? Some are netbios
   names!
A. ntop doesn't SEND NetBIOS queries, it sniffs them off the traffic already on
   the network.

   There is only ONE case where ntop uses the NetBIOS names, which is if 
   it can't resolve them via DNS (both it's own queries and from sniffing
   responses to other's queries off the network).

   So, if you have a properly functioning DNS, you'll see DNS names.  If 
   these are (for example) internal names, unknown to the DNS server, you'll 
   see NetBIOS names if they are available.  Lastly, you'll get IP addresses...

   If you do have a DNS, and the name is resolved as part of the default
   domain, you won't see a fully qualified name back from the DNS, so ntop
   won't have that information.  
   
   So, on a real network you'll often get a mix of name resolution types:

    Host                            IP Address      MAC Address      Other Name(s)
    netnews.attbi.com               63.240.76.16

    homeportal.homeportal.2wire.net 192.168.0.1    00:D0:9E:xx:xx:xx
    swallowtail                     192.168.0.XX   00:A0:CC:xx:xx:xx SWALLOWTAIL [STRAUSS] ...
    12-xxx-xxx-xxx.client.attbi.com 12.xxx.xxx.xxx 00:D0:9E:xx:xx:xx

Q. I don't understand -j | --border-sniffer-mode
A. Welcome to the club <grin />

   Quoting from Luca's comment:
   
   "-j is used when you are starting ntop on a mirrored interface where you
   cannot trust MAC addresses."

   ntop uses MAC addresses for many things to differentiate among machines.
   IP addresses and names can mean many things, but hardware addresses are
   supposed to be unique.  This is usually true, but gets hairy when you
   introduce a switch into the network which is also copying all of the 
   packets it sees to a monitoring port.  

   Understand how a switch works: In short, a switch monitors the network it sees
   and knows which mac address(es) are on which ports.  When it received a packet,
   it forwards it to only that port. Broadcasts are forwarded to all ports.

   So an ntop instance, sniffer, whatever only sees a fraction of the traffic.

   In many managed switches, there is an option for a "repeater" or "monitoring" 
   or "spanned" port, which receives all traffic, so that network monitoring can 
   be performed there.

   However, When the switch sends out packets on the monitoring port, it must 
   rewrite them to be valid Ethernet packets with a valid (i.e. the switch's)
   MAC address and ntop gets confused.

   Note that:

   1. -j usually requires you to specify the local network (-m) as a mirrored
      interface might have a wrong/ip-less/privare IP address.

   2. -j disables some features as TCP session tracking etc.

   In future versions -j will disappear and it will be replaced with more flags
   for better controlling all these options.

   With multiple switches in a hierarchy, you have to place the ntop instance 
   or instances carefully, depending upon what you want to monitor.

   For example, most lans have a switch in each area with it's uplink connected 
   to a backbone switch.  Servers and gateways are then placed off one or more 
   backbone ports.  This keeps departmental traffic isolated from each other, 
   while making enterprise wide and inter-department traffic feasible.  ntop 
   would have to be monitoring the backbone switch, but you would need to be 
   aware of what ntop is NOT seeing and place additional monitors.

   For example, you could place additional ntop instances in the departments, 
   using the netflow or sFlow plugins to receive flow information from them 
   which wouldn't be visible to the backbone instance. (I'll note that I haven't
   actually tried this, myself. -----Burton)


Q. When I run with -j | --border-sniffer-mode, there are different menus.
A. Yes.

   The menus are just html files.  There is a set for regular mode and a
   j_xxx.html set for border sniffer mode.  Why?  Because there are things
   that simply don't work in border-sniffer-mode, so why let the user
   request those pages.

Q. OK, but it changed after 2.1.2 (i.e. in 2.1.50) what are the NEW parameters?
A. There were four new parameters introduced when -j | --border-sniffer-mode 
   was removed.  Whether the old parameter really did all the same things as 
   the new ones is irrelevant and left to code-archiologists.  What matters 
   is what the new ones are and what they do!

   They are:

   -b | --disable-decoders

     This flag disables protocol decoders. Use it for better performance 
     or if you feel ntop has problems handling these protocols in your
     environment.

     This switch disables code in a number of places throughout ntop, code 
     which analyzes specific protocols, but can place additional load on the 
     host.  This switch could be used to run ntop on low-end CPUs or where 
     ntop is acting as a collector (netFlow or sFlow) and the GUI is not
     required.

     Disabled is the analysis of:

        DNS Sniffing - where ntop captures DNS information from other hosts'
                       requests to reduce the # of DNS requests ntop must -
                       itself - make.

        NetBIOS   \
        NetWare    \
        AppleTalk   -- resource intensive protocol analysis of less 
        bootp/dhcp /   common protocols.
        OSI       /

        http (80) - Request success/failure counting on port 80 and other
                    analysis, including "Virtual Host".

        ftp passive session tracking.

        "Wrong Port" monitoring for: http, ftp and smtp (used with the
              -q | --create-suspicious-packets option to dump "suspicious" 
              packets to an analysis file)  With this option, ntop checks
              the payload for each new connection, looking for text usually
              present in http, ftp or smtp requests.  If these are not on the
              "normal" ports (http's 80, ntop's 3000 or squid's 3128, ftp's
              21 or smtp's 25) (or there is a non-ftp or smtp request on the
              standard ports), the packet is logged.


   -g | --track-local-hosts

     Use this flag to tell ntop that you care only about local hosts (use 
     -m | -- local-subnets to specify local nets).  This flag is useful when 
     ntop sees many hosts (e.g. border gateway) but only the local ones need 
     to be tracked.

     This switch disables code in a number of places throughout ntop, code 
     which allows ntop to track "foreign" hosts (that is ones not local 
     according to the IP address(es) of ntop's interfaces or set pseudo-local
     by -m | -- local-subnets).

     Basically, ntop doesn't bother to do DNS resolution on these addresses 
     and, for purposes of various counts, uses the "other" bucket instead of
     creating a unique hash table bucket for the specific host.

     This switch could be used to run ntop on low-end CPUs or where ntop is 
     acting as a collector (netFlow or sFlow) and the GUI is not required.


   -o | --no-mac

     Specifies that ntop should not trust MAC addresses but just IP addresses. 
     This option is useful whenever ntop is started on an interface where MAC 
     (Media Access Controller - the low-level Ethernet address) addresses can
     not really be trusted (e.g. port/VLAN mirror in Switched Ethernet 
     environments).

     Certain processing is performed differently:

          Hash search is via IP not MAC

     Certain capabilities are disabled:

          Analysis of bootp/dhcp requests
          localRoutersList.html report
          Wrong net mask log message and flag
          Analysis of non-tcp/udp protocols like NetWare and Spanning Tree
          Router listing on Host Detailed report.
          Traffic Matrix report

     (Note that this list is subject to change as we learn more about protocols
      that do/do not depend on the MAC address)

     See also -z | --disable-sessions


   -z | --disable-sessions

     This flag disables tcp session tracking. Use it for better performance or 
     when you don't really need the tracking of sessions.

     Also, in situations where the MAC addresses can not be trusted, ntop may
     - or may not - be able to accurately track tcp sessions.  There is no easy 
     way to tell, so this switch puts control back into the users' hands.

     In versions after 2.0 up to & including 2.1.2, the -j | --border-sniffer-mode
     flag (predecessor of -o | --no-mac) always turned this off.  Many users wanted 
     to try turning session tracking back on, and did via code patches with mixed 
     results.

     Suggested usage:  If you enable -o | --no-mac, try running ntop with
     sessions enabled.  If the data looks reasonable, congratulations - your
     network allows session tracking.  If the data does not look reasonable,
     then you will also need to disable session tracking with this switch.

Q. ntop shows an older, single menu interface
A. If ntop is unable to find the file index.html it generates the page 
   internally. That page refers to 'leftindex.html' which is the all-in-one menu 
   you see, similar to the v1.3 menu.

   To find the html files, ntop looks in the html subdirectory in two places: 

      1. In the current directory (i.e. ./html), 
   and 
      2. In '[prefix]/share/ntop/html' 
         (where [prefix] is set by the --prefix option of your ./configure step). 

   Common causes: 

      1. Is manually installing ntop in an unusual place, having forgotten to update
         DATAFILE_DIR in config.h. Or forgetting to copy the html subdirectories, etc. 

      2. Forgetting to run './autogen.sh -1' first and 'make install' last when first
         building ntop from source. 

      3. The 'intop.1' problem discussed in another FAQ entry - this leaves an 
         partial install, which is often missing some or all of the html files. 

      4. Running ntop with an explicit path from somewhere other that the directory 
         it's installed into. For example, if you install ntop into /root/ntop, but
         run it like this: 

            cd /usr/bin 
            /root/ntop/ntop 

         It will look 1st in /usr/bin/html and then in [prefix]/share/ntop and not 
         find the html files in /root/ntop/html!

   This often occurs when running ntop as a daemon, because the current working 
   directory of the script is not what you expect it to be! 
 

Q. What are the default protocols ntop monitors?
A. (These are the ones ntop monitors if the user does not supply a -p parameter)  
   Check addDefaultProtocols() in ntop.c around line 520.  
   The current list (July 2002) is

     Protocol   Ports
	 --------   -----
     FTP        ftp ftp-data
     HTTP       http www https 3128      /* 3128 is HTTP cache */
     DNS        name domain     
     Telnet     telnet login     
     NBios-IP   netbios-ns netbios-dgm netbios-ssn     
     Mail       pop-2 pop-3 pop3 kpop smtp imap imap2     
     DHCP/BOOTP 67-68     
     SNMP       snmp snmp-trap     
     NNTP       nntp
     NFS        mount pcnfs bwnfs nfsd nfsd-status

     WinMX      6699 7730     
     Audiogalaxy 41000-41900     

   Note that the names come from /etc/services (or your system's equivalent).  If
   you add protocols to /etc/services, you can refer to them by name on the -p 
   parameter.


Q. What's changed since v1.3 in that list?
A. Added 25Jan2002: 

          Gnutella: 6346 6347 6348
          Morpheus: 1214 
          WinMX:    6699 7730 

   Added 20Mar2002: 

          Audiogalaxy: 41000-41900

   Removed 26Jan2002: 

          Napster 


Q. What are ntop's options?
A. There are a couple of options that appear only if they're not compiled in, and a few
   that depend on various external libraries, e.g. openSSL.

   The best way to see what is actually available is to run ntop with the -h or 
   --help options and see.

   Here is the FULL set as of July 2002:

     --ssl-watchdog
                                Use ssl watchdog (NS6 problem)

Q. But, what about -A a/k/a --accuracy-level
A. This option was used to set ntop into various modes which performed less 
   processing, in order to handle higher traffic volumes. 

   It was added on 14Dec2001 (just before v2.0) and was removed on 11Mar2002, 
   although traces survived in usage() until April 2002. 

   Note that the CODE remains in initialize.c for use by EXPERTS if necessary.  


Q. But, but, but what about --no-admin-password-hint
A. This option was used to remove the hint text from the administrative password 
   entry message box. 

   It was added 4Feb2002 and removed 8Mar2002 (the last traces, in usage(), were 
   removed on 4Apr2002).  


Q. What does the message "URL security(1): ERROR: Found percent in URL...DANGER...
   rejecting request" mean?						 
A. It means that ntop received a request with a percent sign (%) in it, often used 
   as part of Unicode exploits against various web servers.  Since there is no
   situation where ntop should process this, we reject it.
   URLsecurity in http.c is the place where these tests occur.


Q. What does the message "Rejected request from address x.y.z.t (it previously 
   sent ntop a bad request)" mean?
A. Once you send ntop a request that URLsecurity rejects, the sending address    
   goes into a ring buffer on a 5 minute timeout where we simply drop subsequent 
   requests...  rather than waste cycles ignoring an attack...


Q. What are the other URL security(#) codes?
A. 1.  Found a % in the request (Unicode problems)
   2.  Found a parameter type code (//, &&, ??)
   3.  Found a directory transversal code (..)
   4.  Found a prohibited (RFC1945) character
   5.  Found a bad extension


Q. Is ntop localized for language x? (i18n)
A. No.  ntop isn't really written with i18n in mind.

   Most of the text is generated in-line, on the fly.

   We are certainly open to some sweat equity to fix this!

   My suggestion (Burton's) - as the simplest way - would be to create an 
   new messagetext.h file, with #defines for the various translatable 
   phrases and then work through the code moving text from in-line text to 
   use the #defines.  Once that was in place, we could then look at some 
   form of run-time substitution...


Q. How can I run ntop without being root?
A. A very simple way of doing this is:
   > su
   > chown root ntop
   > chgrp root ntop
   > chmod 6111 ntop
   > exit

   This makes ntop read-only for everyone and sets the setuid and setguid bits.

   Do not forget to use the -u flag so that ntop changes user as soon as it
   is started.

   Understand that setting the Setuid and Setguid bits allows ANY user to run
   ntop and it will run with ROOT privledges.  This is very powerful, and often
   a source of security exposure - many system hardening scripts and 
   recomendations tell you to look for and remove the setuid and setguid bits.

   DO NOT suid UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND THE RISKS!

   Also, there are unconfirmed reports of problems, causing a
      "socket: operation not permitted"
   message.


Q. My security people won't let me run in promiscuous mode.
A. Tough...

   Or, use the -s option and accept the limitations...

   Ask them "honestly, what is the problem" - other than having an interface
   in promiscuous mode is a signature of a sniffer and security folks look for
   unauthorized sniffers?

   ntop needs promiscuous mode so that it sees the full range of traffic.  Any
   similar product will do the same thing.

   If the security people think traffic on the wire is secure, they're wrong!
   Face facts - just about every Windows user, except for 2K/XP Pro (and then
   only if TBTP have especially locked them down)can install the windows
   version of tcpdump...

   If it's a checklist item, just gen up a form to "authorize" it, have the
   boss and VP/CIO sign it and give it to them.


Q. -s | --no-promiscuous doesn't work
A. It should work - it's passed to pcap_open_live.  Understand that it does mean
   ntop sees a lot less comprehensive view of the traffic.  You won't see anything
   different unless you do an ifconfig on the interface.  Note that while the 
   parameter specifies if the interface is to be put into promiscuous mode, even 
   if this parameter is false, the interface could well be in promiscuous mode 
   for some other reason.


Q. ntop doesn't report any traffic at all.
A. Understand how ntop works:  It simply listens on the interface(s) for packets,
   then counts and interprets them.  If there aren't any packets, ntop doesn't
   count things.
 
   ntop does not sample.  It processes every packet it sees and counts them.
   Only if there is more traffic than ntop can handle for a long period of time
   will the packet queue hit it's limit and packets be lost.  But this is still
   not sampling.

   Make sure that there's traffic on the interface(s) you are using. You can
   use tcpdump or a similar network sniffer tool to check.

   If you are on a segmented network (i.e. switched), you may not see traffic
   that isn't destined for the ntop machine unless you configure the switch to
   set the port for the ntop host into "mirror" or "management" mode (different
   vendors call it different things, but it's a mode where ALL traffic is copied
   to a specific port, regardless of which port the destination host is on).

   If there is more than one interface in the ntop host, perhaps you aren't 
   listening on the one that has traffic?  Check using ifconfig:
   
   eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:D0:09:77:85:B9  
             inet addr:192.168.0.34  Bcast:192.168.0.255  Mask:255.255.255.0
             UP BROADCAST RUNNING MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
             RX packets:1105906 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
             TX packets:601935 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
             collisions:0 txqueuelen:100 
             RX bytes:119869887 (114.3 Mb)  TX bytes:112203781 (107.0 Mb)
             Interrupt:11 Base address:0xc000 

    If the RX and TX numbers are increasing, this shows that traffic IS flowing...

   If you have an unnumbered interface (listening only), remember you need to
   use -m to tell ntop what is local and what isn't:

   eth1      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 00:30:F1:54:55:00  
             UP BROADCAST RUNNING PROMISC MULTICAST  MTU:1500  Metric:1
             RX packets:1596612 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
             TX packets:0 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
             collisions:0 txqueuelen:100 
             RX bytes:566953031 (540.6 Mb)  TX bytes:0 (0.0 b)

   You can select an interface using the '-i' flag, e.g. -i eth1 or -i eth0,eth1.


Q. How does -m | --local-subnets work?
A. This  flag  allows users to specify the subnets whose traffic is considered 
   local (called "pseudoLocal" internally).  The format is 
        <network address>/<# subnet mask bits>[,<network address>/<#  subnet mask bits>]. 
   For instance "131.114.21.0/24,10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0".

Q. (followup) but what does it MEAN?
A. Surprisingly, it means EXACTLY what it says.  Treat traffic on the listed subnet(s) 
   as local.

   ntop differentiates between local traffic and remote traffic.  There are actually 
   four classes (although only three are routinely reported) L->L L->R R->L and R->R.

   Suppose your IP is 1.2.3.4 with a 255.255.255.0 netmask (a/k/a 1.2.3.4/24)

   Under the TCP/IP protocol, traffic with any address 1.2.3.1 -> 1.2.3.254 does not 
   get routed.  It's "local".

   Your buddy is at 1.2.3.9 and the router is 1.2.3.1, so your network looks like this:

   the       +--------+
   world-----+ Router +--1.2.3.1--------------------------------------
             +--------+                | 1.2.3.4             | 1.2.3.9
                                  +--------+            +--------+
                                  |  You   |            |  Buddy |
                                  +--------+            +--------+

   Say you send a packet to your buddy at 1.2.3.9. You build a packet with SRC=1.2.3.4 
   DST=1.2.3.9 and you data and cast it out the wire.   (For purposes of this illustration, 
   ignore the fact the your TCP stack would recognize the "local" nature of the packet and 
   actually use another, lower level protocol, called Ethernet to deliver it.)

   The router (1.2.3.1) looks at it, does the math and ignores it - it's local
   Your buddy (1.2.3.9) looks at it, says - gee, that's me and reads it

   This is L->L traffic.

   Now you send a packet to ntop.org at 131.114.21.9.  Again, SRC=1.2.3.4 and now 
   DST=131.114.21.9.

   The router (1.2.3.1) looks at it, does the math and says - oops, I have to send it out 
      to the world
   Your buddy (1.2.3.9) looks at it, says - gee that's NOT me and ignores it

   This is L->R traffic.


   Now it's perfectly possible to have multiple (physical) networks on the same physical 
   wire.  Say that your ISP chooses to put 1.2.4.1-1.2.4.254 (1.2.4.0/24) on the same wire.
   (Why would they do this - maybe it's a big pipe and only a few users or whatever).

   A packet from 1.2.4.4 -> 1.2.4.9 is seen by

   The router - no, that too is local, ignore it
   You (1.2.3.4): (1.2.4.9) - not me - ignore it
   Buddy (1.2.3.9) - um... 1.2.4.9 - not me - ignore it

   And that's perfectly legal.

   But what if you are the ISP and you want ntop to see ALL the traffic on that wire?  
   ntop will figure out from it's own IP address that the 1.2.3.0/24 traffic is local, 
   but it will classify the 1.2.4.0/24 as REMOTE.

   And that is what the --local-subnets switch does.  It tells ntop to treat that 
   1.2.4.0/24 traffic as local.

   If there isn't any other traffic on the wire, then telling ntop to treat it as local 
   won't change a thing.

   You can always use a packet sniffer, such as tcpdump to scan the traffic on the wire 
   and see what's really there...                          (Added, 08Aug2002, BMS)

Q. And internally?
A. ntop is designed as a hybrid packet analyzer, not a pure Ethernet analyzer
   (layer 2) nor a pure TCP/IP analyzer (layer 3).  Most of ntop's displayed
   counts are at the TCP/IP level, and that's what confuses people.  Internally, 
   ntop works both at the level of the Ethernet frame and the TCP/IP packet.

   A single MAC address can be associated with multiple TCP/IP addresses.  The MAC
   address -- unless something is horribly wrong on the network or with the hardware
   or somebody is deliberately spoofing it -- is guaranteed to be unique and refers
   to a physical host or network interface.  For many reports, ntop displays the 
   information using the MAC address to separate physical devices.  Other data is 
   accumulated and displayed at the TCP/IP (level 3) layer.

   -m relates to the traffic you see on the wire at the TCP/IP level.
   -m tells ntop something it can't determine by itself.  And that is to treat
   that range of addresses EXACTLY like it was local.

   For example, on my Cable Modem, I see broadcasts for a number of subnets
   that AT&T has assigned to this area (I don't see the traffic, but you get
   the picture) in an overlay structure (two or more networks on the
   same wire, but with separate address spaces)          .   (Added, 20Sep2002, BMS)


Q. I am using a /16 (/25 or whatever) mask and I get this message:
      Truncated network size to 1024 hosts (real netmask 255.255.255.0)
A. Yes.  ntop limits each network to 1024 hosts (a /24). If you need more, alter the
   #define for MAX_SUBNET_HOSTS in ntop.h and recompile.  Space has to be reserved 
   for this many hosts for each network, so the limit exists to keep memory usage
   from growing to absurd levels on people with "class A" (/8) interfaces (e.g. 10. or
   Cable Modems, etc.).

 
Q. ntop doesn't understand virtual hosts.
A. IP Packets have a source address & port and a destination address & port... 
   you MUST get your head out of the application layers and revert to that simple 
   concept.

   How does Apache handle virtual hosts? It analyzes the flow at the
   application level (layer 4) not the wire/packet/protocol (layers 1, 2 and
   3).  It does this by re-assembling packets into a layer 4 message (e.g. GET
   http://virtual.host.name.com/page.html)...

   So, since ntop works at the packet level, it doesn't understand virtual
   hosts.  It's a NETWORK analyzer, not an application level one.  Which is not 
   to say you couldn't create a plugin that did the layer 4 analysis...  but 
   ntop doesn't.

   (20Sep2002, BMS) Support for virtual hosts is under development and the initial
   support is in 2.1.50.


Q. tcpwrappers does't work
A. Oh yes it does... for http: connections

   1) You have to configure it this way before compiling ntop: 
        ./configure --enable-tcpwrap 

   2) You must have the headers and libraries installed on the build machine 
      (and on the execution machine if they aren't the same).

   Remember to make the appropriate entries in hosts.allow (e.g. ntop:192.168.0.) 
   and hosts.deny (e.g. ntop:ALL) 

   However, tcpwrappers and https:// is known not to work - see docs/KNOWN_BUGS
 

Q. My filter doesn't work!  I'm running ntop like this:
      /usr/local/bin/ntop -u nobody -L -d -E -w 3000 -S 2 \
                          -m 192.168.10.0/24,xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/32 \
                          -M -i eth0,eth1 \
                          (src net 192.168.10.0/24 or src host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ) \
                          and not dst net 192.168.10.0/24 
A. Yup, it doesn't work.  Use the -B option and put the filter in quotes: 
      -B "(src net 192.168.10.0/24 or src host xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ) and not dst net 192.168.10.0/24"

 
Q. I have experienced problems defining multiple filters: ntop reports 'syntax error'
A. If you believe the filter is syntactically correct then it's likely that the libpcap
   you have used has been compiled using an old non-reentrant version of flex.
   Please make sure you're using version 2.5.4 or above.  


Q. Why does ntop use so much memory ?
A. ntop holds a lot of information about each host it has seen in an in-memory table.
   Periodically, it looks at all the entries in the table and flushes any which have
   been idle for a period of time.
   
   You can change the sizing of the table and the flushing interval via #define 
   statements in ntop.h.  
   
   But realistically, ntop needs enough memory to hold information about what's 
   active on YOUR network.

   To reduce memory, monitor fewer protocols or use the filter (-B "bpf filter") 
   option to monitor only parts of the network.

   
Q. What are High/Medium/Low risk flags
A. They are set in reportUtils.c based on fairly self-obvious functions:
      Medium: hasWrongNetmask() 
      High: hasDuplicatedMac()
   Often seen if you are monitoring a backbone or common network (high)
   or if you have cloned MAC addresses for, say, a home Firewall box.


Q. Why create Userids
A. Multiple users allow you to control who can alter ntop's performance and/or
   view specific information. If you look on the "Admin" tab, you will see that you can 
   create additional users and also control which URLs can be executed by whom.

   Userids could allow, for example, an ISP to allow users to access SOME 
   network performance statistics, but not the proprietary stuff... 

   Suppose you want to restrict who accesses the Multicast statistics page, multicastStats.html.

   ntop uses terminal wildcards matching the names, so multicast is treated as multicast*
   and matches multicastStats.html plus any other name beginning multicast...

   howto:

   1st add a new user 
   2nd add "multicast" to the list of controlled screens and allow admin 
       and the new user to access it (note the * wildcard is automatically added)

   Try an access the screen and you are prompted for a userid/password... 

   Look in http.c for all the names and #defines used... 

 
Q. SSL is not working! I have the following error in the log/terminal:
     10/Jun/2002 22:58:17 Started thread (6151) for network packet sniffing on 
          eth0.1700:error:140EC0AF:SSL routines:SSL2_READ_INTERNAL:non sslv2 
          initial packet:s2_pkt.c:187: 
A. You forgot to put https:// instead of http:// in the url you put in your browser! 
 

Q. Unable to find SSL certificate 'ntop-cert.pem'
A. ntop looks such file under the current working directory, then /etc or in whatever
   directory you configured with ./configure. 

   If you want a personal certificate, you need to create it by:

      >make ntop-cert.pem

   It should be installed as part of "make install".  If you have a special certificate
   or it's not present, do it (one-time) manually:
   
   For example to install it under /usr/local/etc, do: 

   mkdir /usr/local/etc 
   cp /usr/local/bin/ntop-cert.pem /usr/local/etc/ntop 
 
   See docs/README.SSL


Q. Can I use ntop from php/perl?
A. Yes you can. Please see the www directory under the ntop sourcetree.  

Q. How do I save data between runs?
Q. What is the -S option?
A. The -S option is the --store-mode option, or the "Persistent storage mode"
   Ntop's internal structures are basically an array of devices (network interfaces), 
   which contains an array of hosts (specific machines seen on the device. 

   So device[0] is the 1st network interface, and device[2] the third. device[0].host[0] 
   would be, say, the local file server and device[0].host[1] would be a simple host. 
   device[1].host[1] is a completely different set of counts from device[0].host[1]. 

   The -S options tells ntop to store information about a specific host in a database from 
   run to run (-S 0 none, -S 1 all and -S 2 only local hosts).

   This is only the count information about the host and does not store the information 
   about a device (a network interface). Further, items of dynamically allocated storage
   (the devices name) are not stored. 

   Data is retrieved on a subsequent run ONLY when traffic is seen from that host after 
   the restart.  (I suppose you could script a ping to each host you care about and force
   the reload that way, but it hasn't been tested...)

   So if you go into the host details (e.g. the 192.168.1.1.html page) you should see 
   prior-run information. 

   But if you're looking for device throughput to be preserved... nope... 

   Also, ntop stores the information during 1) reset and 2) shutdown. So if ntop crashes,
   the persistent data will be lost.  


Q: intop doesn't....
A: Understand that intop hasn't been supported since v1.3.  Only the very
   minimal changes required to make it compile without errors and startup
   in a very simple environment were made.  It hasn't been tested.
   
   What intop really needs is somebody to become it's maintainer.


Q. Where can I find neped/queso?
A. neped (Network Promiscuous Ethernet Detector) - Looks for ethernet cards in 
       promiscuous mode in your local net. 
   queso - Determines the remote OS sending simple tcp packets.

   You could download neped/queso from http://www.apostols.org/ except that site 
   seems to be down...

   neped is at http://packetstorm.decepticons.org/UNIX/IDS/

   queso was found at http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/queso.html (look for
   the .orig.tar.gz file)

Q: Where is the documentation for x?
A: The documentation in the docs/ directory and the FAQs etc. at 
   http://snapshot.ntop.org/ are basically all that there is.  Please
   contribute to the ntop community by writing things up for inclusion
   in this FAQ or other documents!

Q. What is sFlow
A. The core component of the sFlow toolkit is the sflowtool command line utility. 
   sflowtool interfaces to utilities such as tcpdump, ntop and Snort for detailed 
   packet tracing and analysis, NetFlow compatible collectors for IP flow accounting, 
   and provides text based output that can be used in scripts to provide customized 
   analysis and reporting and for integrating with other tools such as MRTG or rrdtool. 

   Some info: 

   http://www.inmon.com/sflowTools.htm 
   http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3176.html  

Q. I have activated the sFlow plugin in ntop. But it doesn't seem to 
   generate any output based on the collected sflow datagrams.
A. sFlow can be a collector or a receiver or both, depending on the
   settings configured via the plugin.

   If you configure ntop as an sFlow collector, it will use sFlow data 
   for generating reports, treating the remote collector(s) as another 
   network interface - see Admin | Switch NIC.


Q. Where is info about netflow?
A. Dale Reed pointed out a good tech doc (no flak, just the formats) for netflow V1/5/7: 

    http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/rtrmgmt/nfc/nfc_2_0/nfc_ug/nfcform.htm  


Q. How do I access netFlow or sFlow data from ntop?
A. You need to configure ntop as a listener (it can also be a collector, but that data shows
   up in the receiving interface, not under netFlow/sFlow).

   First, use the appropriate plugin to set the parameters - basically the port you want ntop
   to listen on.  Then, using the Admin | Set Interface menu item, switch ntop to report on
   the sFlow/netFlow pseudo-device (NetFlow-device or sFlow-device).
   (Added 29Jul2002 by Burton)


Q. Is there any parameter to set to tell ntop which interface/ip address 
   to use when exporting the (netflow/sflow) flows?
A. No. All ntop does is send a packet to the network addressed to the
   destination you request.  
   
   Typically if the ntop host is multihomed, the routing service will pick the 
   the MOST SPECIFIC route with the lowest metric # that is selected.  E.g., if 
   this is the routing table:

   Kernel IP routing table
   Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
   192.168.2.0    0.0.0.0          255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
   192.168.2.129  0.0.0.0          255.255.255.128 U     0      0        0 eth2
   192.168.2.146  0.0.0.0          255.255.255.255 U     0      0        0 eth1
   192.168.2.146  0.0.0.0          255.255.255.255 U     1      0        0 eth2
   127.0.0.0       0.0.0.0         255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo
   0.0.0.0         192.168.2.1     0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0

   A packet to 192.168.2.146 goes via eth1 (equally specific routes, so it chooses
   based on the metric 0 vs. 1)

   A packet to 192.168.2.145 goes via eth2  (192.168.2.129/25 is more specific than
   192.168.2.0/24)

   A packet to 192.168.2.46 goes via eth0

   A packet to 10.1.1.1 goes via eth0 (the gateway is the least specific route, but
   it is the best match)

   But how it goes out (and thus the source IP address) is totally up to the OS.  
   Just be aware when it gets to the netflow/sflow collector, it might have an 
   unexpected ip address as the source.

Q: What is the ssl watchdog?
A: (Added 2002-Sep-09, Burton)

   Short answer: There are reported problems w/ the ntop web server hanging when 
                 accessed via ssl (https://) from Netscape 6.2.2 (Win2K) (and others).

                 The ssl "watchdog" keeps an eye on the web server - it waits for 3 seconds 
                 and then if the SSL_accept call (openSSL) hasn't finished, it aborts it.  
                 This leaves the user with nothing on their web browser, but at least ntop's 
                 web server continues on.

                 There is no know way to send something back to the user. DON'T EVEN ASK.
                 It's not in ntop, it's the browser-server handshake that's hung.
                 So, it looks - to the user - like a failed connection.  S'be'it...

   If you are using https:// and seem to have the problem, run ntop with the --ssl-watchdog 
   command line parameter... The item to look for on the configuration page (info.html) is:

       # HTTPS Request Timeouts 

   Or messages in the log:

   ...: SSLWDERROR: Watchdog timer has expired. Aborting request, but ntop processing continues!

   You can also enable it via a ./configure parameter (./configure --help | less) if it's
   something you're going to always require.


Q. Tell me more
A. The problem is that ntop's web server is single threaded until we determine that the 
   request is simply one that will be reading data.  At that point we fork to generate 
   the page.  But the basic "accept a request" code is single threaded.  This happens 
   all but instantaneously and hasn't been a problem previously.

   The code is pretty basic and pretty common:

       select() to wait for a connection, then
       ssl_accept() to fireup a "server", meaning the ssl handshake.

       Then process the http request (i.e. the GET and associated headers).

   With Netscape 6.2.2 (and others), there seems to be a bug in the Netscape code 
   (ntop's is identical to other projects like sshd).

   According to something I read - but now can't find again - Netscape doesn't accept a 
   legal combination of options on the handshake back from openSSL and hangs in a deadly 
   embrace.  Supposedly openSSL 0.9.6c (or was it d - it's not in the changelog) built 
   in a patch.  However, I didn't find the new version changed the behavior, nor are a 
   lot of vendors shipping those releases (yet).  There is stuff about a bug w/ 
   Netscape 4.x on the openSSL website, but I'm not having trouble with Netscape 4.x.

   I don't understand the details and really don't care to find out.  It boils down to a 
   hang in a call, SSL_accept() that doesn't have a timeout parameter.  Argh...

   Because the code is invasive, I built it (like the SIGPIPE stuff) so you can turn it 
   on at ./configure time:

      --enable-sslwatchdog    Watchdog for ssl hangups (Netscape 6.2.2) [default=disabled]

   or via a command line option:

      --ssl-watchdog          Use ssl watchdog (NS6 problem)

   With the "fix", ntop's web server hangs for at most 3 seconds, then continues on.  The 
   user gets nada - and I don't know a way to send them anything, because we haven't 
   retrieved the request yet nor done the handshake (so there isn't a TCP connection!)

   It only affects https:// requests and I've coded the watchdog so it doesn't activate 
   unless we have openSSL and either the compile or runtime parameter set.  If you don't 
   get https:// requests, it's just another idle thread.

   The fix is working for me... What I've tested (and the results with and without 
   the watchdog):

    Win2k
      MS Internet Explorer 5.5 - ok
      Netscape 4.61 - ok
      Netscape 4.79 - ok
      Netscape 6.2.2 - user gets no response 
                     - old: ntop webserver hung and must restart ntop!!
      Opera 6.03 - user gets a partial response 
                 - old: browser says "setting up secure connection" and never continues, but 
                          ntop webserver is ok  (SOMETIMES you get SSL errors in log, esp. 
                          if you cancel the browser)

Section 2 - Specific Platforms
==============================

FYI: ntop development is done primarily on Solaris (Solaris 8 for i386)
     and Linux (specifically RedHat 7.2 w/ updates).


Solaris
=-=--=-

Q. How do I install the ntop package on Solaris?
A. For instance do 'pkgadd -d ntop-2.1-solaris.i386'


BSD
=-=

Q. When I type 'make' it complains about a makefile error.
A. Always remember to use gmake on *BSD systems! (and possibly other systems as well.)


Linux
=-=-=

Compiling
---------

Q. Which libraries do I need to compile ntop under RedHat 7.2:
A.     glibc, glibc-devel
       gcc
       cpp
       gawk
       autoconf
       automake
       openssl, openssl-devel (for https:// support)
       gdbm, gdbm-devel
       libpcap
       mysql-devel (for mySQL support)

     (Note some packages will have additional packages as pre-requisites)

Q. I have compile problems, especially with plugings. 
A. Be sure and regenerate everything on your machine, that is 

       ./autogen.sh -1 
       ./configure 
       make 
       make install 

   Running autogen is always safe and is a really good idea, because it 
   recreates all of the make and configure stuff from the .in and .am files 
   based on your specific configuration. Otherwise, you are trying to use the 
   ones that happened to be generated on the machine of whomever uploaded them 
   last to the CVS and that's not always a good match...  


Q. I get an error:
   /usr/bin/install: cannot create regular file
   make install-man1 install-man8 
   make[3]: Entering directory `/root/src/ntop/ntop' 
   /bin/sh ./mkinstalldirs /usr/local/man/man1 
   /usr/bin/install -c -m 644 ./intop/intop.1 
   /usr/local/man/man1/intop/intop.1 
   /usr/bin/install: cannot create regular file 
   `/usr/local/man/man1/intop/intop.1': No such file or directory 
   make[3]: *** [install-man1] Error 1 
A. This is an automake problem.  First off, the Makefile was patched long prior to
   release of 2.1 and this should not occur.  However, here are the two
   work-arounds:

   1) create the directory manually - note that the intop.1 man file will probably 
      not be accessible to man. 

   2) Change versions of automake. This typically is a problem with 1.4p5 (which is 
      shipped with RedHat 7.x). Versions 1.4 and 1.5 are reported to work ok, but 
      you must recreate the various files with 

          ./autogen.sh -1 
 

Q. Why do I have to "make install" when building libpng??
A. You don't. 

      IF you use the buildAll.sh script in gdchart0.94c 
   or IF you don't try to be (too) clever while manually 
         building the libpng library. 

   The difference between makefile.gcc and makefile.linux in the scripts directory of 
   libpng-1.2.4 is that makefile.gcc builds a static library, while makefile.linux 
   builds both the static (.a) and shared (.so) libraries. 

   Most people doing a manual build of the tools see ".linux" and use it, vs. the 
   more generic sounding ".gcc", but ntop expects the ".gcc" build.

   The problem is that ldd (the loader) prefers the .so (shared) version and if it
   finds it, it will link to it, even if a .a version exists.  So if you make the
   static .a, but have the .so, that (.so) is what ntop will use.

   For your own personal use, it shouldn't matter - there is NOTHING wrong with the
   shared libraries, as long as the same version of the .so libraries for libpng are 
   installed on BOTH the build and execution machine(s). 

   This could happen either via a distribution supplied package (but if the package 
   was for version 1.0.x this WILL cause version problems).
   
   Or, you can install the .so library by typing "make install" the 1st time you 
   build libpng. 

   Best suggestion is to use buildAll.sh! 
   (Updated 22Aug2002 - BMS - libpng-1.2.4)

Q. What about Slackware
A. Lorenzo had "Installation Notes For Slackware 8.0" available at 
       http://80.19.145.20/ntop-Slack-inst.txt
   although the site may (as of July2002) be down.



Running
-------

Q. Segmentation fault on startup while inititializing GDBM (Slackware)
A. This occurs if one's crypt(3) does not support the standard UNIX crypt
   (and just returns NULL)... Change CRYPT_SALT in ntop.h from 99 to $1$99 
   thereby forcing md5 crypting..    (reported in 1.3 era)

Q. ntop isn't able to capture data.
A. On some (old) Linux distributions, the libpcap package is broken. Please remove it, 
   get the source, build libpcap and install it (both the library and the include files).
   Then rebuild ntop from scratch.  (reported in 1.3 era)


Q. Bad things - I see the following messages: 
        libpng warning: Application was compiled with png.h from libpng-1.0.x 
        libpng warning: Application is running with png.c from libpng-1.2.x 
        gd-png: fatal libpng error: Incompatible libpng version in application and library 
A. You have a version problem with libpng. 

   First off, following the instructions in BUILD-NTOP.txt should work just fine. These 
   problems come about when you have libpng installed (i.e. using shared libraries). 

   1. If you are compiling from source, you may have png.h left over from the earlier
      version of libpng. Remove it. 

   2. (Most common under RedHat). RedHat 7.2 installs a libgd.so.1.8.4 library, which was 
   compiled against 1.0.x series of libpng (which is fine, because RedHat 7.2 includes 
   libpng-1.0.12). 

   Updating RedHat to newer (RawHide) packages for libpng, 
   http://www.rpmfind.net//linux/RPM/rawhide/1.0/i386/RedHat/RPMS/libpng-1.2.2-5.i386.html, 
   should work. However, there are reports of version conflicts and required updates to 
   multiple packages. Proceed with caution (especially if you decide to uninstall 1.2.2-5). 
   Also, do not use --nodeps or --force, as this can leave you with two partially installed 
   versions (see item #1, above). 

   3. (Slackware) Users have reported this error from an older header file in /usr/include. 
   Make sure to run "make install" in the libpng directory so that the latest files are in 
   the common library locations. You can do this with buildAll.sh, just navigate back down 
   to the libpng-1.2.x directory first.  

   4. If you are building ntop on one machine and running on another, they may have
   different libpng.so versions.  Even if you think you are using the static linked
   version (buildAll.sh), be careful - see the entry (above) on "make install" for libpng.
   (Updated 22Aug2002 - BMS - libpng-1.2.4)


Win32 (MinGw)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Compiling
---------

Q. When I type 'make' it complains about a makefile error.
A: Remember to use -f Makefile.MinGW or whatever is appropriate - see BUILD-MinGW.txt.

Q. Where can I find GDBM for Windows?
A. GDBM for windows can be found at http://www.roth.net/libs/gdbm/  

Q. Mingw make of Ntop fails when using the single-file distribution MinGW-1.1.tar.gz
   with make errors about version.c like : 
    zsh: no matches found: *version 
    make: *** [version.c] Error 1 
A. Be sure that your PATH setting in the DOS command box of the Mingw bin directory
   ends with a backslash.
    This is OK: 
        set path=C:\Mingw\bin\;%path% 
    This is wrong:
        set path=C:\Mingw\bin;%path% 
                             ^


Running
-------
Q. ntop -i1 ... doesn't work
A. ntop has special parameters under Win32

         Under win32 there are TWO COMPLETELY SEPARATE TYPES OF PARAMETERS.

     There are the parameters to the win32 stub AND there are parameters to ntop itself.

     AFTER THE win32 parameters are the ntop parameters in the standard (Unix) -xxx format.

         ntop /c <normal parms>  runs ntop INTERACTIVELY with the specified ntop parameters

	 ntop /i <parameters> installs ntop as a service to run with the specified parameters

	 ntop /d deletes the ntop service

   Remember, ntop /i and ntop /d don't actually run the service - you need to start it.
   (Updated 26Aug2002 - BMS)

Q. How do I figure out what my network interface numbers are for the -i parameter?
A. (Thanks to jac engel [jacengel@home.nl] for the example)

   If you only have ONE network interface, it doesn't matter as the default is fine.  However,
   that's the RARE case.  Most people have multiple network interfaces (NICs), with virtual
   ones for VPNs, Dialup Networking, etc.

   The Windows tools ipconfig, winipcfg and the Device Manager (depending on which version
   of Windows you have) will probably show you them.  However, it's easier and better to 
   use ntop to show you how ntop sees the network interfaces.

   If you start  ntop /c (interactive mode, with only the default parameters) it will 
   display all your network interfaces (NICs), like this:

    Running ntop for Win32.
    Wait please: ntop is coming up...

    23/Aug/2002 20:43:55 Found interface [index=1] '\Device\Packet_{86AE91B6-1F55-497C-9AEF-E208305084B4}'

  By default, ntop will use the lowest numbered interface.  Because #s are assigned based on
  the sequence cards are discovered, and this is altered if cards are removed and added, this
  is often not what you want.

  After you figure out which NIC you want, start ntop /c -i1 or -i2 or whatever...

  (Added 13Sep2002, Burton)

Q. OK, but how to I translate \Device\Packet_xxxxx to my Froboz ModelT network card and not the
   Fubar27 that's on the motherboard.
A1. A Google search on script "CurrentVersion\NetworkCards" finds a couple of scripts/utilities
   that might work in various environments.

   Otherwise...

   You're going to need to view the registry.  All the usual warnings - back up your pc, etc.
   If you damage the registry, you may not be able to reboot the computer.  You're not going
   to CHANGE anything, but an inadvertent keystroke could be disaster ... BE CAREFUL!

   Under WinNT/2K, to find the interface name of your NIC look in the registry at the 
   keys in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\Currentversion\NetworkCards\
   The two subkeys, Servicename and the Description tells you which id maps to which NIC.

   (Added 13Sep2002, Burton)

Q. Where does ntop look for html (and gif) files under Win32?
A. ntop looks in two places. The first is the current directory and the second is 
   configurable through a constant in ntop_win32.h, #define DATAFILE_DIR "."

   Note that the current directory, or ".", may not be what you expect.

   When running ntop as a Win32 service, "." is %SystemRoot%\system32, meaning that ntop 
   looks in %SystemRoot%\system32\html for the .html and .gif files.

   When running ntop from the command line, 

       ntop /c parameters...

   "." is whatever directory is current.  This means that if you run ntop with a full, 
   explicit path (c:\ntopnew\ntop /c ...) there may be an unexpected difference between 
   what ntop finds for "." and what you THINK "." is!  This will lead to missing .html 
   and .gif files.

   If you wish to have ntop look in a specific place for the files, the best choices are:

     1) Create a .bat file to run ntop which does a cd to the expected directory first.
     2) Edit ntop_win32.c and then recompile.

   Note that the settings for DATAFILE_DIR (and other constants) are reported on the text 
   version of the configuration page, textinfo.html. (Added 14Jul2002 Burton)


Other Platforms - not very well supported...
============================================

   
   
BSD Information
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Q. I get "ntop: /dev/bpf0: Device not configured", what's wrong?
A. This is because bfpX has not been configured inside the generic bsd-kernel 
   config file. 

   If you use generic kernel config file put "pseudo-device bpfilter 16" in kernel
    config file and rebuild the kernel.  


HP-UX
=-=-=

Q: v2.0.99RCx has been reported not to compile under HP-UX 10.20
A: The test in the code seems wrong, but we didn't have time, nor 
   the ability to test it before releasing 2.1.  Specifically,
   
   #if !defined(WIN32) && !defined(AIX)
   extern int h_errno; /* netdb.h */
   #endif

   should probably be

   #if !defined(HAVE_NETDB_H)
   extern int h_errno; /* netdb.h */
   #endif


Q: Why the HP-UX version of ntop isn't multithreaded?
A: To reduce complexity and because resources aren't availabe to provide
   full support for less commonly used OSes. Specifically Because HP's 10.20
   pthread implementation is slightly different from the POSIX standard.


IRIX (v1.3 information)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Q. Where can I find pthreads for IRIX 6.2?
A. Irix 6.2 doesn't support POSIX threads out of of the box. You must 
   install the patch: 2791

Q: Why the IRIX version of ntop doesn't use semaphores although 
   they are implemented in the OS?
A: When Luca used IRIX 6.2, semaphores seemed to have some problems. This is a 
   implementation issue only because ntop supports threads under IRIX.


Digital UNIX (v1.3)
===================

Q. ntop doesn't seem to collect any data on Digital Unix.
A. Albert Chin-A-Young <china@thewrittenword.com> said:
   First, to compile, make sure you don't use '-std1' which will cause problems
   compiling pbuf.c. '-std' is ok.

   Once ntop is compiled, do the following:
        1. Make sure 'options PACKETFILTER' is in your kernel
           configuration file under /sys/conf. Recompile the
           kernel using 'doconfig -c [config file]' if necessary.
        2. % cd /dev
           % ./MAKEDEV pfilt
           % pfconfig +promisc [interface]

   The last part of #2 I didn't do so ntop did not collect any data.

AIX (v1.3)
==========

Q. AIX: I've linked ntop against the special libcap library that's
   available on the ntop sire. Unfortunately ntop doesn't work. It
   fails with the following error:

   as stated in the Updates log ( http://www-frec.bull.com/docs/downlist.htm )
   
           This distribution uses the "dlpi" interface. If the dlpi
           stream drivers are not loaded, the command
                   # strload -f /etc/dlpi.conf
           should be executed after every reboot.
   
   have fun

Networking...
=============

Q. What is Ethernet and TCP/IP and how do they differ?
A. Both are protocols - that is the definition of how
   to interpret bits on wires (or in packets) into
   meaningful conversations.

   Ethernet is the lower level, wire (or wireless) protocol,
   concerned with moving the physical bits of data.

   TCP/IP is the higer level protocol, which explains
   how to interpret the block of bits (frame).

   TCP/IP uses a familiar 32 bit "IP" address, e.g.
   192.168.0.1.

   Ethernet uses a less familiar, 48 bit unique to the NIC
   (some times called "burned in") address, e.g. 
   00:40:05:DE:AD:00.  This is called the MAC (Media
   Access Control) address.

   FYI: The offical IEEE MAC address lookup is at 
       http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/index.shtml
   (Look up the first six digits, separated by -s, e.g. 00-40-05)


Q. OK, but how is stuff sent from my computer to, say, Yahoo!?
A. First off, your computer does a lookup - using a service
   called DNS (Domain Name Service) to convert www.yahoo.com
   to a numeric value, such as 66.218.71.80.

   Then it builds a collection of characters that says send
   this data from me, 192.168.0.1 to Yahoo at 66.218.71.80.
   This is called a packet.  That gets wrapped in an Ethernet
   frame (addressed from 00:40:05:DE:AD:00 to the MAC address
   of the local gateway router, 0:d0:9e:6:38:00 and squirts it
   out the router.

   Packets are forwarded step by step along a path from you
   to Yahoo by computers called routers.  This is done based 
   on the 32 bit IP address and the router's knowledge of the
   network.

   Each router sees a Ethernet frame addressed to it (by
   MAC address), checks the TCP/IP address to figure out 
   where to send it next, re-wraps the TCP/IP packet in a new
   Ethernet frame (with the from MAC as it's own and the to
   MAC as the next hop).

   This happens until the TCP/IP packet reaches the final
   segment (the last router).  Once it reaches a router that
   knows it has addresses 66.218.71.0-66.218.71.255 on one
   of it's interface, the routing stops using the TCP/IP
   address.

   The last hop is done (like each intermediate hop - at the 
   lowest level) based on the MAC address!  Specifically, the 
   last router does an "ARP" (Address Resolution Protocol") query,
   to find out "Who Has" address 66.218.71.80.  The NIC responds 
   with it's MAC address:

      arp who-has www.yahoo.com tell router
      arp reply www.yahoo.com is-at 0:d0:9e:6:38:00

   And the packet is routed to that address.

   Alright, that's a bit simplified, but see Douglas Comer,
   "Internetworking with TCP/IP, volume I", page 25 and 73ff.

Q. So what's a hub vs. a Switch
A. A hub is a device that links a bunch of computers together
   at the wire (Ethernet) level.  Logically, Ethernet is a bus,
   that is everybody sees all the traffic, just like cars crossing
   under a highway bridge.   Physically, Ethernet is wired like
   a star - with all the wires coming back to a central "hub".
   The hub is just the device that makes the electric star look
   like a shared bus.

   Switches and Hubs operate at the Ethernet level, not TCP/IP.

A. A switch is a smart hub.

   Switches improve performance by creating a virtual Ethernet
   bus for the duration of the packet that joins JUST the source
   and destination ports.

   A switch operates via an internal table of MAC addresses.
   It learns (or is programmed) that 0:d0:9e:6:38:00 is on
   port 1, while 00:40:05:DE:AD:00 is on port 3.

   A packet coming in port 1, destined for 00:40:05:DE:AD:00
   is sent out ONLY port 3.

   If the switch doesn't know (or the packet is a broadcast),
   it gets sent out all ports.

   This doesn't make for MORE bandwidth, but it does use it
   more efficiently.  That is in addition to the session between 
   ports 1 and 3 at 100Mbps, a second, simultaneous 100Mbps 
   session can occur between ports 2 and 4.

Q. How do I use ntop in a switched network?
A. First off, you need to be or have the support of
   your network administrator.  (Yes, you can do something
   called "ARP poisoning" to - maybe - get the switch to send
   you all the traffic, but that's beyond this FAQ... STFW)

   Many switches (although not the USD$50 cheap "workgroup" units)
   have a special port or mode, where by all the traffic for the
   entire network gets copied out that port, in addition to the
   normal switch action.

   When you invoke the monitoring mode (called span, mirror, monitor,
   analysis, etc.), you are forcing the entire switch bandwidth out one 
   port.  This may exceed the bandwidth of the port.  100Mbps+100Mbps 
   >> 100Mbps!

   Traffic that is being sent to the monitoring port in excess of the 
   capacity of that port is usually dropped.  It should NOT slow down
   the switch on other ports.  

   Some switches have some buffering capability and it *may* be able to 
   keep up with an occasional burst of traffic, as long as the average 
   is below the port capacity and the buffer isn't exceeded.

   See, for example, http://www.cisco.com/warp/public/473/41.html#archXL.

   One list of switch manufacturers is the document is titled "REFERENCE: 
   Configuring a Switch to Monitor All Traffic" from Elron Software. (The 
   URL is long, do a Google search for "site:elronsoftware.com wi6038").

HowTo Ask For Help (ntop mailing lists)
=======================================

Please understand that the mailing list is a community support effort. Despite any 
individual's frequent postings, nobody is "responsible" for answering your question. 
It's all on a "best efforts" basis. This is equally true of the FAQs posted at 
http://snapshot.ntop.org. Our responses may be incomplete, in-accurate, even dead 
wrong. Caveat Emptor! The only "guarantee" is that free support will be worth what
you've paid for it. 

Use ntop for problems running ntop.
Use ntop-dev for problems with the code.

A response from an @ntop.org user is somebody affiliated with the project. Most of 
the people responding on ntop or ntop-dev are not formally affiliated with the project. 
We answer questions to the best of our ability, find problems, create and test patches 
and send them in to patches@ntop.org for inclusion. 

Please direct all original postings and subsequent replies to the list, not to someone 
privately. Most of us will reply solely to the mailing list, unless you specifically 
request otherwise. If you do request otherwise, the individual you sent it to may 
choose not to respond. Our posting here is NOT a public invitation to invade our e-mail 
boxes for your free private support. 

You MUST use meaningful message subjects - one's that would have helped YOU find the 
prior discussion of this or a similar problem in the archives. Titles such as "urgent" 
or "ntop problem" will often not get a response - it may be urgent to you but... 

Understand that we can't see your machine (and wouldn't want the responsibility of
sshing into somebody else's box as root). The only information we have is what you 
post and the responses to our questions. 

Also, understand that ntop is under rapid development. The only way to fix your problem 
may be a source patch, which you will have to apply, compile and install. If you aren't 
capable of doing that, then ... 

If you want better than "best-efforts" support, contact the individual you desire support 
from off-list to make financial arrangements. Please understand that people are doing 
development in areas that are of personal interest to them, to improve ntop. If you want 
to discuss payment for support or a specific change that is of interest to you, feel free 
to email the individual off-list - some of us are computer consultants and can be bought, 
with the understanding that the work product is offered back to the community in the 
spirit of the open source movement and the strictures of the GPL. 

***Do not worry about posting TOO much information - we're pretty good at filtering out 
the noise, especially if you organize your information the way we request it, below*** 


BEFORE POSTING: 

1. Please review back message traffic from the mailing lists. 
Your specific problem HAS been discussed recently. 

2. Please review the ntop community FAQs at http://snapshot.ntop.org. 

POSTING: 

In general, please give us more information (see the specifics we request, below)... 

1. A brief summary of the problem. 

2. Operations 
The EXACT command line you use to invoke ntop. 
If it's in a script, cut & paste it and 
resolve all the variables! 

Error Messages: Cut & paste the exact text. 
If it's in the log, give us 15 or 20 lines before. 

If the problem is a segmentation fault, include the backtrace (available under gcc 
compiled version if you use the -K flag.)

The exact URL you used from the browser. 

3. Software 
NTop version, source and any applied patches 

If you've compiled from the source, say so! 

If you're using a package (such as an .rpm), where did you get it from and what 
is the EXACT name, version information and date? (for example, post the output 
from rpm -q ntop -i) 

OS vendor & version 

gcc version (e.g. gcc --version) 

glibc version 

Any major upgrades (kernel, networking, etc.) 

What else is running 

4. Hardware 
Type & # of processors 

Amount of memory 

# network interfaces and types (vendor, bus, etc.) 

5. Network 
Roughly where are the interface(s) you're monitoring (Public Internet, Private LAN,
what?) 

What's the bandwidth (e.g. 10 Mbps University internet, 1.5 Mbps T1, Cable Modem 
capped at 1.5Mbps, 56K dialup) 

How many machines (traffic sources/destinations) and users 

(If you're uncomfortable giving specifics, then leave it generic, but the information 
is necessary to allow efficient use of the community's time helping YOU with YOUR problem) 

AFTER POSTING: 

Please let us know if our help fixed the problem, didn't solve it or enabled you to 
solve it yourself and what the result was. The historical record of the ntop and 
ntop-dev archives is the complete chain from problem to resolution.

GDB ultraMini-tutorial - Running ntop under gdb (debugger)
==========================================================

The very best way to debug a segmentation fault in ntop is to use gdb. The standard
ntop compile already has the flags necessary to do this set. 

(Note - if you don't have gdb, or aren't compiling yourself, this won't work) 

> gdb /usr/bin/ntop (or wherever ntop is installed) 
... 
(gdb) set args (your usual arg string) -K 

[That is, add the -K argument. While you are at it, don't give it the -d argument 
and add -u root (replace any existing -u value) - yes, it's insecure running as root,
 but you're not planning on doing this in production nor as a routine situation!] 

it will run... when it bombs... 

(gdb) list [this shows where in the code it died] 

(gdb) info stack [this shows the call stack] 

if there are any variables involved, you can print them: 

(gdb) print deviceId 

[gdb can handle pretty complex arguments in the print command, so you can say 
"print myGlobals.device[0].hash_hostTraffic[myGlobals.broadcastEntryIdx]"
if that's what it bombed on.] 

"bt full" does a decent job of printing the stack and the back trace and the local 
variables at each level. Just make sure you are in the thread you are interested in:
