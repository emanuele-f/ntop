.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ntop
shows the current network usage. It displays a list of hosts that are
currently using the network and reports information concerning the (IP and non-IP) 
traffic generated by each host.
.B ntop
may operate as a front-end collector (sFlow and/or netFlow plugins) or as a stand-alone
collector/display program. A web browser is needed to access the information captured by the 
.B ntop
program. 

An older, and unsupported version,
.B intop
can be started in a terminal window.

.PP
.SH "COMMAND\-LINE OPTIONS"

.It @filename
The text of 
.B filename
is copied - ignoring line breaks and comment lines (anything following a #) - into the
command line.
.B ntop
behaves as if all of the text had simply been typed directly on the command line.
For example, if the command line is "-t 3 @d -u ntop" and file d contains 
just the line '-d', then the effective command line is -t 3 -d -u ntop.  
Multiple @s are permitted.

Remember, most 
.B ntop 
options are "sticky", that is they just set an internal flag. Invoking 
them multiple times doesn't change 
.B ntop's 
behavior. However, options that set a value, such as --trace-level, will use the LAST value
given: --trace-level 2 --trace-level 3 will run as --trace-level 3.

.It2 -a --access-log-path
By default 
.B ntop
does not maintain an http log. Use this flag to specify the path of the file where HTTP 
accesses will be logged. Each log entry is in Apache-like style. 
The only difference between Apache and 
.B ntop
is that an additional column has been added which has the time (in milliseconds) that 
.B ntop 
needed in order to serve the request. 

.It2 -b --disable-decoders
This flag disables protocol decoders (e.g. DNS, NetBIOS). 
Use it for better performance or if you feel 
.B ntop
has problem handling some protocols.

.It2 -c --sticky-hosts
By default idle hosts are periodically purged from memory. 
Use this flag to prevent idle hosts from being purged from memory. 
NOTE: if idle hosts are kept in memory you can experience severe memory usage.

.It2 -d --daemon
This flag causes ntop to become a daemon, i.e. it is started in background and runs 
detached from the terminal.

.It2 -e --max-table-rows
Is the maximum number of HTML table rows that
.B ntop
will display. 

.It2 -f --traffic-dump-file
Specifies the file containing tcpdump captured traffic that has to be used by ntop. 
NOTE: if you specify -f ntop will not capture any traffic after the file has been read. 
This option is mostly used for debug purposes.

.It2 -g --track-local-hosts
Use this flag to tell
.B ntop 
that you do care only about local hosts (use -m to specify local nets). 
This flag is useful on large networks or those that see many hosts,
(e.g. a border router or gateway), yet only the local ones need to be tracked.

.It2 -h --help
Print help information for 
.B ntop
, including usage.

.It2 -i --interface 
Specifies the network interface used by
.B ntop

If multiple interfaces are used (this feature is available only if ntop is compiled with 
thread support) their names must be separated with a comma. For instance -i "eth0,lo".

By default, traffic information obtained by all the interfaces is merged together as if 
the traffic were seen by only one interface. 
Use the -M flag to keep traffic separate by interface.

Win32 note: This is the number of the interface, not it's name. 
Run 
.B ntop
-h to see a list of interface name-number mappings (at the end of the help information).

.It2 -k --filter-expression-in-extra-frame
When this flag is used, the current filter expression is printed in an extra frame and 
thus always visible.

.It2 -l --pcap-log
Dumps the network traffic captured by ntop in a file in pcap format (useful for debug).

.It2 -m --local-subnets
This flag allows users to specify the subnets whose traffic is considered local. 
The format is <network address>/<# subnet mask bits>[,<network address>/<# subnet mask bits>]. 
Both netmasks and CIDR notation may be used, for instance "131.114.21.0/24,10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0".

.It2 -n --numeric-ip-addresses
This causes
.B ntop
to show numeric IP addresses instead of the symbolic names. This option can useful 
when the DNS is not present or quite slow.  Under intop, you can toggle the address format 
(numeric vs. symbolic) by pressing the
.B n
key while 
.B intop
is running.

.It2 -o --no-mac
Specifies the user
.B ntop
should not trust MAC addresses but just IP addresses. 
This option is useful whenever ntop is started on an interface where MAC addresses cannot 
be really trusted (e.g. port/VLAN mirror).

Be aware that information which is dependent upon the MAC addresses (such as IPX) will not 
be collected nor displayed.

.It2 -p --protocols
It is used to specify the TCP/UDP protocols that
.B ntop
will monitor. The format is <label>=<protocol list> [, <label>=<protocol list>], where
label is used to symbolically identify the <protocol list>. The format of <protocol list>
is <protocol>[|<protocol>], where <protocol> is either a valid protocol specified inside the
/etc/services file or a numeric port range (e.g. 80, or 6000-6500). 
If the -p flag is omitted the following default value is used: 

  FTP=ftp|ftp-data
  HTTP=http|www|https|3128     3128 is Squid, the HTTP cache
  DNS=name|domain
  Telnet=telnet|login
  NBios-IP=netbios-ns|netbios-dgm|netbios-ssn
  Mail=pop-2|pop-3|pop3|kpop|smtp|imap|imap2
  DHCP-BOOTP=67-68
  SNMP=snmp|snmp-trap
  NNTP=nntp
  NFS=mount|pcnfs|bwnfs|nfsd|nfsd-status
  X11=6000-6010
  SSH=22

  Peer-to-Peer Protocols
  ----------------------
  Gnutella=6346|6347|6348
  Kazaa=1214
  WinMX=6699|7730
  DirectConnect=0      Dummy port as this is a pure P2P protocol
  eDonkey=4661-4665

  Instant Messenger
  -----------------
  Messenger=1863|5000|5001|5190-5193

If the <protocol list> is very long you may store it in a file (for instance protocol.list).
To do so, specify the file name instead of the <protocol list> on the command line.  e.g.
.B ntop 
-p protocol.list instead of 
.B ntop 
-p FTP=ftp|ftp-data,HTTP=http|www|https|3128 ...

.It2 -q --create-suspicious-packets
Forces ntop to create a file ntop-suspicious-pkts.XXX.pcap (XXX is the interface name) file.
One file is created for each network interface where suspicious packets are found.
The file is in pcap format (tcpdump).

.It2 -r --refresh-time
Specifies the delay (in seconds) between screen updates (the default is 3 seconds). 

Please note that if the delay is very short (1 second for instance), ntop might not
be able to process all the network traffic.

.It2 -s --no-promiscuous
Use this flag for preventing 
.b ntop
from setting the interface(s) into promiscuous mode.

.B ntop
must probably still be started as root, since the libpcap function on most systems
require it to capture raw packets.

This eliminates the ability of capturing ethernet frames regardless of whether they 
are directed to the local ethernet card or to the ethernet broadcast address.

Even if you use this flag, the interface could well be in  promiscuous mode as other 
applications may have enabled it.

.It2 -t --trace-level
This flag specifies the level of
.B ntop
tracings on stdout. The trace level ranges between 0 (no trace) and 5 (full debug tracings). 
The default trace value is 3. The higher is the trace level the more information are printed. 
Trace level 1 is used to print errors only, level 2 for both warnings and errors, and so on.

Trace level 4 is called 'noisy' and it is.  It also enables a MSGID-nnnnn tag on every
message, which may be useful for log watchers.

.It2 -u --user
Specifies the user
.B ntop
should run as after it initializes. The value specified may be either a
username or a numeric user id. The group id used will be the primary group of
the user specified.  
If this parameter is not specified, ntop will try to switch first to 'nobody' and then 
to 'anonymous' before giving up.

.It2 -w --http-server
.B ntop
offers an embedded web server so that users can attach their web browsers to the
program and browse traffic information remotely.
This parameter specifies the port (and optionally the address (i.e. interface))
of the
.B ntop
web server.
For example, if started with -w 3000 (the default port), the URL to access 
.B ntop
is http://hostname:3000/.  If started with a full specification, e.g. -w 192.168.1.1:3000,
.B ntop
listens on only that address/port combination.

If -w is set to 0 the HTTP port will not be enabled ('-w 0' is accepted only if 
.B ntop
has been compiled with HTTPS support and has not been started with '-W 0' [see below]).

Some examples:

.B ntop -w 3000 -W 0 
(this is the default setting) HTTP requests on port 3000 and no HTTPS.
 
.B ntop -w 80 -W 443 
Both HTTP and HTTPS have been enabled on their most common ports.
 
.B ntop -w 0 -W 443 
HTTP disabled, HTTPS enabled on the common port.

An external HTTP server is NOT required NOR supported.  The
.B ntop
web server is embedded into the application.

By default user/URL administration are password protected and are accessible initially
only user 
.B admin
with a password set during the first run of 
.B ntop
.

Users can modify/add/delete users/URLs using ntop itself - see the Admin tab.

The passwords, userids and URLs to protect with passwords are stored in a database file.
Passwords are stored in an encrypted form in the database for further security. 

.It2 -z --disable-sessions
This flag disables TCP session tracking. 
Use it for better performance or when you don't really need/care to track sessions.

.It2 -A --set-admin-password
This flag is used to start 
.B ntop
, set the admin password and quit. It is quite useful for installers that may need 
to automatically set the password for the admin user.

-A and --set-admin-password (without a value) will prompt the user for the password.

You may set a specific value using --set-admin-password=value.  
.B The = is REQUIRED!

.It2 -B --filter-expression
.B ntop
, similar to what tcpdump does (and using the same BPF - Berkeley Packet Filter syntax), 
this allows the user to specify an expression which restricts the traffic seen by
.B ntop
You may use this to select only the traffic of interest. For instance, suppose you
are interested only in the traffic generated/received by the host jake.unipi.it. 
.B ntop
can then be started with the following filter: 'ntop -B "src host jake.unipi.it 
or dst host jake.unipi.it"'. i

See the 'expression' section of the
.B tcpdump
man page for further information about BPF filters.

.It2 -C --large-network
This flag is a hint for 
.B ntop
: as the network being analyzed will be large, 
.B ntop 
will build a more efficient hash and save memory by disabling some features 
(e.g traffic distribution during the day) that take up a large amount of memory.

.It2 -D --domain
This identifies the local domain suffix, e.g. ntop.org.  It may be necessary, if
.B ntop
is having difficulty determining it from the interface.

.It2 -E --enable-external-tools
By default 
.B ntop 
does not take advance of lsof even if present. Use this flag if you want make 
.B ntop 
enable it's use of lsof if lsof is present.

.It2 -F --flow-spec
It is used to specify network flows similar to more powerful applications such as NeTraMet. 
A flow is a stream of captured packets that match a specified rule. The format is 

.B <flow-label>='<matching expression>'[,<flow-label>='<matching expression>']

, where the label is used to symbolically identify the flow specified by the expression. 
The expression format is specified in the appendix. If an expression is specified, then 
the information concerning flows can be accessed following the HTML link named 'List NetFlows'.

For instance define two flows with the following expression 
.B "LucaHosts='host jake.unipi.it or host pisanino.unipi.it',GatewayRoutedPkts='gateway gateway.unipi.it'".

All the traffic sent/received by hosts jake.unipi.it or pisanino.unipi.it is collected by
.B ntop
and added to the LucaHosts flow, whereas all the packet routed by the gateway gateway.unipi.it 
are added to the GatewayRoutedPkts flow. If the flows list is very long you may store in a 
file (for instance flows.list) and specify the file name instead of the actual flows list 
(in the above example, this would be 'ntop -F flows.list').

.It2 -K --enable-debug
Use this flag to simplify application debug.  It does three things:
1. Does not fork() on the "read only" html pages.
2. Displays mutex values on the configuration (info.html) page.
3. (If available - glibc/gcc) Activates an automated backtrace on application errors.

.It2 -L --use-syslog=facility
Use this flag for using the syslog instead of stdout. 
Please note that if ntop (ever) forks a child, regardless of this setting, the syslog 
will be used for this child.
The (optional) parameter value indicates the facility (e.g. daemon, security) to be used for 
logging, using --use-syslog=facility. 
.B The = is REQUIRED!

.It2 -M --no-interface-merge
Forces 
.B ntop 
not to merge network interfaces together. This means that 
.B ntop 
will collect statistics for each interface and report them separately - see Admin | Switch NIC
to select which interface to report.

Note that the netFlow and sFlow plugins will force the setting of -M.

.It2 -O --output-packet-path
Base path for the ntop-suspicious-pkts.XXX.pcap and normal packet log file (in tcpdump format). 
If the base path is a directory you have to append a / to the string for this to work.

.It2 -P --db-file-path
This specifies where 
.B ntop
's db files created.

Note that the default, "." may not be what you expect when running
.B ntop
as a daemon or Win32 service.  Setting an explicit value is 
.B STRONGLY
recommended. 

.It2 -U --mapper
Specifies the URL of the mapper.pl utility.
.B ntop
creates a hyperlink to this URL by appending ?host=xxxxx and creates a clickable button.
Any type of host lookup could be performed, but this is intended to lookup the geographical
location of the host.

A cgi-based mapper interface to http://www.multimap.com is part of the 
.B ntop 
distribution [see www/Perl/mapper.pl]).

.It2 -V --version
Prints 
.B ntop 
version information and then exits.

.It2 -W --https-server
If 
.B ntop
has been compiled with HTTPS support (via OpenSSL), this flag can be used to set the 
HTTPS port and address.  
If the user specifies '-W 0', HTTPS support is disabled.  This is the default (disabled).

For more information, see the -w parameter above.

.It --throughput-bar-chart
Format the throughput charts with bars instead of as an area chart.

.It --dynamic-purge-limits
Enable a dynamic adjustment of the idle host purge limits.  Normally the purge is limited
to 1/3 of the hash size or 512 hosts (whichever is smaller) per cycle.  This switch allows
.B ntop 
to dynamically adjust the limit so that the purge takes between 0.5 and 5.0 seconds
(but the minimum dynamic limit is 64 per cycle).  These values may be adjusted via compile
time constants.

.It --reuse-rrd-graphics
Enable the reuse of rrd graphics if appropriate (no rrd updates in the interim).  
By default, with the flag not set, the graphics are recreated for each request.

.It --p3p-cp
Tells ntop what to return in the p3p header, cp="xxxx".

.It --p3p-uri
Tells ntop what to return in the p3p header, policyref="xxxx".

.It --disable-stopcap
Return 
.B ntop 
to the old (v2.1) behavior on a memory error.  
The default of stopcap enabled makes the web interface available albeit with static 
content until 
.B ntop
is shutdown.

.It --ignore-sigpipe                                    
Enable a handler for SIGPIPE errors. This usually happens only under debug (gdb).
(also available as a ./configure option, --enable-ignoresigpipe)

.It --use-sslwatchdog
Enables a 'watchdog' for 
.B ntop 
webserver hangs.  These usually happen when connecting
with Netscape 6.2.2 and some other browsers - but only via https:// urls.  

The symptom is that the user gets nothing back and other users can't connect.  
Internally, the web server hangs in SSL_accept().
While packet processing continues, there is no way to access the 
data through the web server or shutdown 
.B ntop
cleanly.  

With the watchdog, a timeout occurs after 3 seconds, and processing continues 
with a log message.
Unfortunately, the user sees nothing - it just looks like a failed connection.
(also available as a ./configure option, --enable-sslwatchdog)

.SH "WEB VIEWS"
While
.B ntop
is running, multiple users can access the traffic information using conventional web browsers.
The main HTML page is divided is three frames. 
The top frame is a familiar tabbed navigation bar, containing items such as 'Total', 'Sent'
and 'IP Protos'.
The left frame allows users to select the specific traffic view from among those for 
the tab.  The resulting data will be displayed in the right frame. 

.SH NOTES
.B ntop
requires a number of external tools.
Other tools are optional, but add to the program's capabilities.


Required libraries include:

.B libpcap
from http://www.tcpdump.org/ 

The Win32 version makes use of
.B libpcap for Win32
which may be downloaded from http://winpcap.polito.it/install/default.htm).
WARNING: The 2.x series of 
.B libpcap for Win32
releases will NOT support SMP machines.
.

.B gdbm
from http://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/gdbm.html
.

.B ntop
requires a POSIX threads library. Although a single-threaded version of 
.B ntop
can be built from the source if requested during ./configure, it is not 
recommended for more than trivial usage.
.

.B intop 
requires ncrypt and readline.
.


Optional libraries include:

The 
.B gdchart
library, available at http://www.fred.net/brv/chart/.  Note that 
.B ntop distributes an enhanced version of gdchart, 0.94c, as part of the 
.B ntop
source tree.
.B ntop has not be tested with the (development/beta) releases of gdchart (the 0.10 
and 0.11 series).
.

The
.B gd
library, for the creation of gif files, available at http://www.boutell.com/gd/.
The 1.8.3 version of gd is included with gdchart 0.94c in the
.B ntop
source tree.
.B ntop
has not been tested with any other version.  
.

The
.B libpng
library, for the creation of png files, available at http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html.
Note that a version of libpng, 1.2.4, is distributed with the
.B ntop
source tree.
.B ntop
will also work with the 1.0.x series, which is distributed in many Linux distribtions.

.B HOWEVER
the two series, 1.0 and 1.2, are not compatible nor interoperable.  If compiled against one
version and executing against another,
.B ntop
will fail to create graphics.

There is logic in the build script (gdchart0.94c/buildAll.sh) and in the program to attempt
to catch this and rectify the problem or notify the user.
This may not work in all cases.
If you have a problem with graphics not being produced, check the 
.B ntop
log and check the installed versions of libpng.
.

(if an https:// server is desired)
.B openSSL
from the OpenSSL project available at http://www.openssl.org.
.

The
.B rrdtool
is required by the rrd plugin.  rrdtool creates 'Round-Robin databases' which are used
to hold and graph historical data.  The rrdtool home page is 
http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/

.B ntop
has been tested with rrdtool versions 1.0.38 -> 1.0.41.
.B ntop
has NOT been (successfully) tested with the rrdtool development versions, and there
are significant differences between the two branches.

Also, please note that there is a patched version of rrdtool 1.0.41 available in the
.B ntop
files area of SourceForge.  This contains a bug fix (which will be part of rrdtool 
1.0.42 when released).  Without this fix,
.B ntop
may - rarely - crash during the create/update of an rrd.
.

The 
.B sflow
Plugin is courtesy of and supported by InMon Corporation, http://www.inmon.com/sflowTools.htm.
.

There are other optional libraries.  See the output of ./configure for a fuller listing. 
.


An optional tool, which
.B ntop
will utilize if available, is
.B lsof
available from ftp://vic.cc.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof/README.

lsof is used to present a remote view of the open files on the 
.B ntop
host.

Note that lsof must be configured suid root to enable it's use.
.B The user is cautioned to fully understand the security implications of this setting before enabling it.
.B ntop
will function quite properly without the lsof tool.
