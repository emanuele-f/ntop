DESCRIPTION
       ntop shows the current network usage. It displays  a  list
       of  hosts that are currently using the network and reports
       information concerning the (IP and non-IP) traffic  gener-
       ated by each host.  ntop can be started either in a termi-
       nal window (see intop ) or in  web  mode.  In  the  latter
       case, a web browser is needed to use the program.



COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
       -a | --access-log-path
        By   default   ntop   logs  HTTP  accesses  in  the  file
        ntop.access.log in the current directory. Use  this  flag
        to  specify the path of the file where HTTP accesses will
        be logged. Each log entry is in  Apache-like  style.  The
        only  difference  between  Apache  and  ntop is that ntop
        added a new column has been added. Such  column  contains
        the  time  (in milliseconds) that ntop needed in order to
        serve the request.


       -b | --disable-decoders
        This flag disables protocol decoders (e.g. DNS, NetBIOS).
        Use  it  for  better  performance or if you feel ntop has
        problem handling some protocols.


       -c | --sticky-hosts
        By default idle hosts are periodically purged  from  mem-
        ory.  Use  this  flag  to  prevent  idle hosts from being
        purged from memory. NOTE: if idle hosts are kept in  mem-
        ory you can experience severe memory usage.


       -d | --daemon
        This  flag  causes  ntop  to  become a daemon, i.e. it is
        started in background and detached from the terminal.


       -e | --max-table-rows
        Is the maximum number of HTML table rows that  ntop  will
        display.


       -f | --traffic-dump-file
        Specifies  the  file  containing tcpdump captured traffic
        that has to be used by ntop. Note: if you specify -f ntop
        will  not  capture  any  traffic  after the file has been
        read. This option is mostly used for debug purposes.


       -g | --track-local-hosts
        Use this flag to tell ntop that you do  care  only  about
        local  hosts (use -m to specify local nets). This flag is
        useful when ntop sees many hosts  (e.g.  border  gateway)
        but only the local ones need to be tracked.


       -h | --help
        Print help information for ntop , including usage.


       -i | --interface
        Specifies  the network interface used by ntop If multiple
        interfaces are used (this feature is  available  only  if
        ntop  is  compiled  with  thread support) they have to be
        separated with a comma. For instance -i "eth0,lo".  Traf-
        fic  information obtained by all the interfaces is merged
        together as if the traffic would have  been  produced  by
        one interface. Use the -M flag for not merging traffic.

        Win32 note: This is the number of the interface, not it's
        name. Use ??? to see a list of interfaces.


       -k | --filter-expression-in-extra-frame
        When this flag is used, the current filter expression  is
        printed in an extra frame and thus always visible.


       -l | --pcap-log
        Dumps  the  network traffic captured by ntop in a file in
        pcap format (useful for debug).


       -m | --local-subnets
        This flag allows  users  to  specify  the  subnets  whose
        traffic  is  considered  local.  The  format  is <network
        address>/<# subnet mask bits>[,<network address>/<#  sub-
        net        mask        bits>].        For        instance
        "131.114.21.0/24,10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0".


       -n | --numeric-ip-addresses
        This causes ntop to show numeric IP addresses instead  of
        the  symbolic  names. This option can useful when the DNS
        is not present or quite slow.  You can toggle the address
        format (numeric vs. symbolic) by pressing the n key while
        ntop is running.


       -p | --protocols
        It is used to specify the  TCP/UDP  protocols  that  ntop
        will  monitor.  The  format is <label>=<protocol list> [,
        <label>=<protocol list>], where label is used to symboli-
        cally identify the <protocol list>. The format of <proto-
        col list> is <protocol>[|<protocol>], where <protocol> is
        either  a  valid  protocol specified inside the /etc/ser-
        vices  file  or  a  numeric  port  range  (e.g.  80,   or
        6000-6500).  If  the  -p  flag  is  omitted the following
        default      value      is      used:       "FTP=ftp|ftp-
        data,HTTP=http|www|https|3128,DNS=name|domain,Telnet=tel-
        net|login,NBios-IP=netbios-ns|netbios-dgm|netbios-
        ssn,Mail=pop-2|pop-3|pop3|kpop|smtp|imap|imap2,DHCP/BOOTP=67-68,SNMP=snmp|snmp-
        trap,NNTP=nntp,NFS=mount|pcnfs|bwnfs|nfsd|nfsd-sta-
        tus,X11=6000-6010,SSH=22,Gnutella=6346|6347|6348,Mor-
        pheus=1214,WinMX=6699|7730,Audiogalaxy=41000-41900,Nap-
        ster=8888|8875"  If  the <protocol list> is very long you
        may store in a  file  (for  instance  protocol.list)  the
        value  of  the  <protocol list> and specify the file name
        instead of the <protocol list> (in above example you will
        invoke 'ntop -p protocol.list').


       -q | --create-suspicious-packets
        Forces   ntop   to   create   a   file   ntop-suspicious-
        pkts.XXX.pcap (XXX is the interface name) for  each  net-
        work  interface  where are stored suspicious packets. The
        file is in pcap format (tcpdump).


       -r | --refresh-time
        Specifies the delay (in seconds) between  screen  updates
        (the  default  is  3 seconds). If the -l flag is used, it
        specifies how often entries are logged in the  log  file.
        Please note that if the delay is very short (1 second for
        instance), ntop might not be able to process all the net-
        work traffic.


       -s | --no-promiscuous
        Use  this  flag  for disabling interface promiscuous mode
        (i.e. the ability to capture ethernet  frames  regardless
        whether  they  are directed to the local ethernet card or
        to the ethernet broadcast address). Note that even if you
        use  this flag, the interface could well be in  promiscu-
        ous mode as other  applications  can  have  enabled  this
        functionality.   *****NOTE:  This  is  not  functional in
        v2.0/2.1 of ntop.  It  is  a  future  place-holder  ONLY.
        *****


       -t | --trace-level
        This flag specifies the level of ntop tracings on stdout.
        The trace level ranges between 0 (no trace) and  5  (full
        debug tracings). The default trace value is 3. The higher
        is the trace level  the  more  information  are  printed.
        Trace  level  1 is used to print errors only, level 2 for
        both warnings and errors, and so on.


       -u | --user
        Specifies the user ntop should run as after  it  initial-
        izes.  The  value specified may be either a username or a
        numeric user id. The group id used will  be  the  primary
        group of the user specified.


       -o | --no-mac
        Specifies  the  user  ntop should not trust MAC addresses
        but just IP addresses. This  option  is  useful  whenever
        ntop  is started on an interface where MAC addresses can-
        not be really trusted (e.g. port/VLAN mirror).


       -w | --http-server
        ntop sports an embedded web  server  so  that  users  can
        attach  their  web  browsers  to  the  specified port and
        browse traffic information remotely. Supposing  to  start
        ntop  at  the port 3000 (default port), the URL to access
        is http://hostname:3000/. Users and URLs to protect  with
        passwords  are  stored  in  a  database  file. By default
        user/URL administration are accessible  uniquely  by  the
        user admin with password admin Passwords are stored in an
        encrypted form into the database  for  further  security.
        Please  note  that  an HTTP server is NOT needed but it's
        embedded into the application. If -w is set to 0 the HTTP
        port will not be enabled ('-w 0' is accepted only if ntop
         has been compiled with HTTPS support and  ntop  has  not
        been  started with '-W 0' [see below]).  You can also use
        the IP:Port notation to bind ntop to  the  specified  IP-
        Address, e.g.  -w 127.0.0.1:3000


       -z | --disable-sessions
        This  flag disables TCP session tracking. Use it for bet-
        ter performance or when you don't really care of tracking
        sessions.


       -A | --set-admin-password


       -B | --filter-expression
        ntop  ,  similar  to  what  tcpdump does, allows users to
        specify an expression that restricts the type of  traffic
        handled  by  ntop  hence  to  select  only the traffic of
        interest. For instance, suppose to be interested only  in
        the traffic generated/received by the host jake.unipi.it.
        ntop can then be started with the following filter: 'ntop
        src  host  jake.unipi.it  or dst host jake.unipi.it'. See
        the tcpdump man page for further information  about  this
        topic.


       -D | --domain
        This  identifies  the local domain suffix, e.g. ntop.org,
        if ntop is having  difficulty  determining  it  from  the
        interface.


       -E | --enable-external-tools
        By  default  ntop does not take advance of lsof/nmap even
        if present. Use this flag if you want make ntop aware  of
        such tools (if present).


       -F | --flow-spec
        It  is used to specify network flows similar to more pow-
        erful applications such as NeTraMet. A flow is  a  stream
        of captured packets that match a specified rule. The for-
        mat   is   <flow-label>='<matching   expression>'[,<flow-
        label>='<matching  expression>'], where the label is used
        to  symbolically  identify  the  flow  specified  by  the
        expression.  The  expression  format  is specified in the
        appendix. If an expression is specified, then the  infor-
        mation  concerning  flows  can  be accessed following the
        HTML link named 'List NetFlows'.  For instance suppose to
        define  two  flows  with  the following expression "Luca-
        Hosts='host         jake.unipi.it         or         host
        pisanino.unipi.it',GatewayRoutedPkts='gateway       gate-
        way.unipi.it'". All the traffic  sent/received  by  hosts
        jake.unipi.it  or  pisanino.unipi.it is collected by ntop
        and added to the LucaHosts flow, whereas all  the  packet
        routed  by  the gateway gateway.unipi.it are added to the
        GatewayRoutedPkts flow. If the flows list  is  very  long
        you  may  store  in  a file (for instance flows.list) the
        list of flows and specify the file name  instead  of  the
        flows  list  (in  above  example you will invoke 'ntop -F
        flows.list').


       -K | --enable-debug
        Use this flag to simplify  application  debug.   It  does
        three  things: 1. Does not fork() on the "read only" html
        pages.  2. Displays mutex  values  on  the  configuration
        (info.html)  page.   3.  (If available - glibc/gcc) Acti-
        vates an automated backtrace on application errors.


       -L
        Use this flag for using the  syslog  instead  of  stdout.
        Please  note  that  if  ntop (ever) forks a child, in any
        case the syslog will be used for this child.


       --use-syslog=facility
        Use this flag for using the syslog instead of stdout. The
        parameter  value  indicates  the  facility  (e.g. daemon,
        security) to be used for logging.  Please  note  that  if
        ntop (ever) forks a child, in any case the syslog will be
        used for this child.


       -M | --no-interface-merge
        Forces ntop not to  merge  network  interfaces  together.
        This  means  that  ntop  will collect statistics for each
        interface and will not merge data together.


       -N | --no-nmap
        Forces ntop not to use nmap (if it is installed).


       -O | --output-packet-path
        Base path for the ntop-suspicious-pkts.XXX.pcap and  nor-
        mal  packet  log  file  (tcpdump).  If the base path is a
        directory you have to append a / to the string  for  this
        to work fine.


       -P | --db-file-path
        This  allows  to  specify  where db-files are searched or
        created (default "."). In addition DBPATH/html  is  added
        to the searchlist for the WEB-files


       -S | --store-mode
        Use  this flag for telling ntop to save information about
        host traffic on shutdown. Valid values  are:  0  =  don't
        store  hosts,  1  = store all hosts, 2 = store only local
        hosts. This flag allows ntop not to loose  traffic  stats
        across  multiple ntop sessions. Please note that informa-
        tion about TCP session is (obviously) lost.


       -U | --mapper
        It specifies the UTR of the mapper.pl utility (it's  part
        of  the  ntop  distribution [see www/Perl/mapper.pl]) for
        displaying host location. If you don't want to install  a
        mapper use http://jake.ntop.org/cgi-bin/mapper.pl


       -V | --version
        Prints ntop version information and then exits.


       -W | --https-server
        If  ntop  has  been  compiled  with  HTTPS  support  (via
        OpenSSL), this flag can be used to  set  the  HTTPS  port
        (default 3001 ). If the user specifies '-W 0', HTTPS sup-
        port is disabled. Some examples: 1.  ntop -w  80  -W  443
        (both  HTTP  and HTTPS have been enabled at their default
        ports) 2.  ntop -w 0 -W 443 (HTTP disabled, HTTPS enabled
        at the default port).  You can also use the IP:Port nota-
        tion to bind ntop to the specified IP-Address,  e.g.   -w
        127.0.0.1:3001


       --throughput-bar-chart
        Format  the  throughput charts with bars instead of as an
        area chart.


       --dynamic-purge-limits
        Enable a dynamic adjustment of the idle host  purge  lim-
        its.   Normally  the  purge is limited to 1/3 of the hash
        size or 512 hosts (whichever is smaller) per cycle.  This
        switch  allows  ntop  to  dynamically adjust the limit so
        that the purge takes between 0.5 and 5.0 seconds (but the
        minimum dynamic limit is 64 per cycle).  These values may
        be adjusted via compile time constants.


       --ignore-sigpipe
        Enable a handler for SIGPIPE errors. This usually happens
        only under debug (gdb).  (also available as a ./configure
        option, --enable-ignoresigpipe)


       --use-sslwatchdog
        Enable a watchdog for ntop webserver hangs.   These  usu-
        ally happen when connecting with Netscape 6.2.2 and other
        browsers - only via https:// urls.  The user gets nothing
        back  and other users can't connect.  Internally, the web
        server hangs in SSL_accept().   While  packet  processing
        continues, there is no way to access the data through the
        web server or shutdown ntop cleanly.  With the  watchdog,
        a  timeout occurs after 3 seconds, and processing contin-
        ues with a log message.   Unfortunately,  the  user  sees
        nothing  - it just looks like a failed connection.  (also
        available as a ./configure option, --enable-sslwatchdog)


WEB VIEWS
       While ntop is running, multiple users can access the traf-
       fic  information using conventional web browsers. The main
       HTML page, is divided is two frames. The left frame allows
       users to select the traffic view that will be displayed in
       the right frame. Available sections are: sort  traffic  by
       data  sent, sort traffic by data received, traffic statis-
       tics, active hosts list, remote to local (i.e. inside  the
       subnet  defined  for the network board from which the pro-
       gram is currently sniffing) IP traffic, local to remote IP
       traffic,  local  to  local  IP traffic, list of active TCP
       sessions, IP protocol distribution statistics, IP protocol
       usage, IP traffic matrix.
