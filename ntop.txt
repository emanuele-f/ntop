[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mntop [22mshows the current network usage. It displays a list of hosts  that
       are  currently using the network and reports information concerning the
       (IP and non-IP) traffic generated by each host.  [1mntop [22mmay operate as  a
       front-end  collector (sFlow and/or netFlow plugins) or as a stand-alone
       collector/display program. A web browser is needed to access the infor-
       mation captured by the [1mntop [22mprogram.



[1mCOMMAND-LINE OPTIONS[0m
       [1m@filename[0m
        The  text  of  [1mfilename  [22mis  copied - ignoring line breaks and comment
        lines (anything following a #) - into the command line.  [1mntop  [22mbehaves
        as  if  all  of the text had simply been typed directly on the command
        line.  For example, if the command line is "-t 3 @d -u ntop" and  file
        d contains just the line '-d', then the effective command line is -t 3
        -d -u ntop.  Multiple @s are permitted.

        Remember, most [1mntop [22moptions are "sticky", that is  they  just  set  an
        internal  flag.  Invoking  them  multiple  times doesn't change [1mntop's[0m
        behavior. However, options that set a value,  such  as  --trace-level,
        will  use  the  LAST value given: --trace-level 2 --trace-level 3 will
        run as --trace-level 3.


       [1m-a | --access-log-path[0m
        By default [1mntop [22mdoes not maintain an http log. Use this flag to  spec-
        ify  the path of the file where HTTP accesses will be logged. Each log
        entry is in Apache-like style.  The only difference between Apache and
        [1mntop  [22mis  that  an additional column has been added which has the time
        (in milliseconds) that [1mntop [22mneeded in order to serve the request.


       [1m-b | --disable-decoders[0m
        This flag disables protocol decoders (e.g. DNS, NetBIOS).  Use it  for
        better  performance or if you feel [1mntop [22mhas problem handling some pro-
        tocols.


       [1m-c | --sticky-hosts[0m
        By default idle hosts are periodically purged from memory.   Use  this
        flag  to  prevent  idle hosts from being purged from memory.  NOTE: if
        idle hosts are kept in memory you can experience severe memory  usage.


       [1m-d | --daemon[0m
        This  flag causes ntop to become a daemon, i.e. it is started in back-
        ground and runs detached from the terminal.


       [1m-e | --max-table-rows[0m
        Is the maximum number of HTML table rows that [1mntop [22mwill display.


       [1m-f | --traffic-dump-file[0m
        Specifies the file containing tcpdump captured traffic that has to  be
        used by ntop.  NOTE: if you specify -f ntop will not capture any traf-
        fic after the file has been read.  This  option  is  mostly  used  for
        debug purposes.


       [1m-g | --track-local-hosts[0m
        Use  this  flag  to  tell [1mntop [22mthat you do care only about local hosts
        (use -m to specify local nets).  This flag is useful on large networks
        or  those  that see many hosts, (e.g. a border router or gateway), yet
        only the local ones need to be tracked.


       [1m-h | --help[0m
        Print help information for [1mntop [22m, including usage.


       [1m-i | --interface[0m
        Specifies the network interface used by [1mntop[0m

        If multiple interfaces are used (this feature  is  available  only  if
        ntop  is  compiled  with thread support) their names must be separated
        with a comma. For instance -i "eth0,lo".

        By default, traffic information obtained  by  all  the  interfaces  is
        merged  together  as  if  the traffic were seen by only one interface.
        Use the -M flag to keep traffic separate by interface.

        Win32 note: This is can be either the number of the interface  or  its
        name.  Run [1mntop [22m-h to see a list of interface name-number mappings (at
        the end of the help information).


       [1m-k | --filter-expression-in-extra-frame[0m
        When this flag is used, the current filter expression is printed in an
        extra frame and thus always visible.


       [1m-l | --pcap-log[0m
        Dumps  the  network  traffic captured by ntop in a file in pcap format
        (useful for debug).


       [1m-m | --local-subnets[0m
        This flag allows users to specify the subnets whose traffic is consid-
        ered   local.    The   format  is  <network  address>/<#  subnet  mask
        bits>[,<network address>/<# subnet mask  bits>].   Both  netmasks  and
        CIDR       notation      may      be      used,      for      instance
        "131.114.21.0/24,10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0".


       [1m-n | --numeric-ip-addresses[0m
        This causes [1mntop [22mto show numeric IP addresses instead of the  symbolic
        names.  This  option  can  useful when the DNS is not present or quite
        slow.


       [1m-o | --no-mac[0m
        Specifies the user [1mntop [22mshould not trust MAC  addresses  but  just  IP
        addresses.   This  option  is  useful  whenever  ntop is started on an
        interface where MAC addresses cannot be really trusted (e.g. port/VLAN
        mirror).

        Be  aware  that  information which is dependent upon the MAC addresses
        (such as IPX) will not be collected nor displayed.


       [1m-p | --protocols[0m
        It is used to specify the TCP/UDP protocols that  [1mntop  [22mwill  monitor.
        The  format  is  <label>=<protocol  list> [, <label>=<protocol list>],
        where label is used to symbolically identify the <protocol list>.  The
        format of <protocol list> is <protocol>[|<protocol>], where <protocol>
        is either a valid protocol specified inside the /etc/services file  or
        a numeric port range (e.g. 80, or 6000-6500).  If the -p flag is omit-
        ted the following default value is used:

          FTP=ftp|ftp-data
          HTTP=http|www|https|3128     3128 is Squid, the HTTP cache
          DNS=name|domain
          Telnet=telnet|login
          NBios-IP=netbios-ns|netbios-dgm|netbios-ssn
          Mail=pop-2|pop-3|pop3|kpop|smtp|imap|imap2
          DHCP-BOOTP=67-68
          SNMP=snmp|snmp-trap
          NNTP=nntp
          NFS=mount|pcnfs|bwnfs|nfsd|nfsd-status
          X11=6000-6010
          SSH=22

          Peer-to-Peer Protocols
          ----------------------
          Gnutella=6346|6347|6348
          Kazaa=1214
          WinMX=6699|7730
          DirectConnect=0      Dummy port as this is a pure P2P protocol
          eDonkey=4661-4665

          Instant Messenger
          -----------------
          Messenger=1863|5000|5001|5190-5193

        If the <protocol list> is very long you may store it in  a  file  (for
        instance  protocol.list).   To do so, specify the file name instead of
        the <protocol list> on the command line.  e.g.  [1mntop [22m-p  protocol.list
        instead of [1mntop [22m-p FTP=ftp|ftp-data,HTTP=http|www|https|3128 ...


       [1m-q | --create-suspicious-packets[0m
        Forces ntop to create a file ntop-suspicious-pkts.XXX.pcap (XXX is the
        interface name) file.  One file is created for each network  interface
        where  suspicious packets are found.  The file is in pcap format (tcp-
        dump).


       [1m-r | --refresh-time[0m
        Specifies the delay (in seconds) between screen updates  (the  default
        is 3 seconds).

        Please  note  that if the delay is very short (1 second for instance),
        ntop might not be able to process all the network traffic.


       [1m-s | --no-promiscuous[0m
        Use this flag  for  preventing  from  setting  the  interface(s)  into
        promiscuous mode.

        [1mntop  [22mmust  probably still be started as root, since the libpcap func-
        tion on most systems require it to capture raw packets.

        This eliminates the ability of capturing ethernet frames regardless of
        whether  they are directed to the local ethernet card or to the ether-
        net broadcast address.

        Even if you use this flag, the interface could well be in  promiscuous
        mode as other applications may have enabled it.


       [1m-t | --trace-level[0m
        This  flag  specifies  the level of [1mntop [22mtracings on stdout. The trace
        level ranges between 0 (no trace) and 5 (full  debug  tracings).   The
        default  trace  value  is  3.  The  higher is the trace level the more
        information are printed.  Trace level 1 is used to print errors  only,
        level 2 for both warnings and errors, and so on.

        Trace  level  4 is called 'noisy' and it is.  It also enables a tag on
        every message, which may be useful for log watchers.

        Trace level 5 is 'noisy' plus --log-extra 1, i.e. with a file:line tag
        on every message.


       [1m-u | --user[0m
        Specifies  the user [1mntop [22mshould run as after it initializes. The value
        specified may be either a username or a numeric user id. The group  id
        used will be the primary group of the user specified.  If this parame-
        ter is not specified, ntop will try to switch first  to  'nobody'  and
        then to 'anonymous' before giving up.


       [1m-w | --http-server[0m
        [1mntop  [22moffers an embedded web server so that users can attach their web
        browsers to the program and browse traffic information remotely.  This
        parameter  specifies the port (and optionally the address (i.e. inter-
        face)) of the [1mntop [22mweb server.  For example, if started with  -w  3000
        (the  default  port), the URL to access [1mntop [22mis http://hostname:3000/.
        If started with a full specification, e.g. -w  192.168.1.1:3000,  [1mntop[0m
        listens on only that address/port combination.

        If  -w  is  set  to  0  the  HTTP  port will not be enabled ('-w 0' is
        accepted only if [1mntop [22mhas been compiled with HTTPS support and has not
        been started with '-W 0' [see below]).

        Some examples:

        [1mntop  -w 3000 -W 0 [22m(this is the default setting) HTTP requests on port
        3000 and no HTTPS.

        [1mntop -w 80 -W 443 [22mBoth HTTP and HTTPS have been enabled on their  most
        common ports.

        [1mntop -w 0 -W 443 [22mHTTP disabled, HTTPS enabled on the common port.

        An  external  HTTP server is NOT required NOR supported.  The [1mntop [22mweb
        server is embedded into the application.

        By default user/URL administration  are  password  protected  and  are
        accessible  initially  only  user [1madmin [22mwith a password set during the
        first run of [1mntop[0m

        Users can modify/add/delete users/URLs using ntop  itself  -  see  the
        Admin tab.

        The  passwords,  userids and URLs to protect with passwords are stored
        in a database file.  Passwords are stored in an encrypted form in  the
        database for further security.


       [1m-z | --disable-sessions[0m
        This  flag  disables  TCP session tracking.  Use it for better perfor-
        mance or when you don't really need/care to track sessions.


       [1m-A | --set-admin-password[0m
        This flag is used to start [1mntop [22m, set the admin password and quit.  It
        is  quite useful for installers that may need to automatically set the
        password for the admin user.

        -A and --set-admin-password (without a value) will prompt the user for
        the password.

        You  may set a specific value using --set-admin-password=value.  [1mThe =[0m
        [1mis REQUIRED![0m


       [1m-B | --filter-expression[0m
        [1mntop [22m, similar to what tcpdump does (and using the same BPF - Berkeley
        Packet  Filter  syntax), this allows the user to specify an expression
        which restricts the traffic seen by [1mntop [22mYou may use  this  to  select
        only the traffic of interest. For instance, suppose you are interested
        only in the traffic  generated/received  by  the  host  jake.unipi.it.
        [1mntop [22mcan then be started with the following filter: 'ntop -B "src host
        jake.unipi.it or dst host jake.unipi.it"'. i

        See the 'expression' section of  the  [1mtcpdump  [22mman  page  for  further
        information about BPF filters.


       [1m-D | --domain[0m
        This  identifies  the  local  domain suffix, e.g. ntop.org.  It may be
        necessary, if [1mntop [22mis having difficulty determining it from the inter-
        face.


       [1m-F | --flow-spec[0m
        It  is used to specify network flows similar to more powerful applica-
        tions such as NeTraMet.  A flow is a stream of captured  packets  that
        match a specified rule. The format is

        [1m<flow-label>='<matching  expression>'[,<flow-label>='<matching expres-[0m
        [1msion>'][0m

        , where the label is used to symbolically identify the flow  specified
        by  the  expression.   The  expression  format  is  specified  in  the
        appendix. If an expression is specified, then the information concern-
        ing  flows  can  be  accessed following the HTML link named 'List Net-
        Flows'.

        For  instance  define  two  flows  with   the   following   expression
        [1mLucaHosts='host  jake.unipi.it or host pisanino.unipi.it',GatewayRout-[0m
        [1medPkts='gateway gateway.unipi.it' .[0m

        All   the   traffic   sent/received   by   hosts   jake.unipi.it    or
        pisanino.unipi.it  is  collected  by  [1mntop  [22mand added to the LucaHosts
        flow, whereas all the packet routed by  the  gateway  gateway.unipi.it
        are  added  to  the  GatewayRoutedPkts flow. If the flows list is very
        long you may store in a file (for instance flows.list) and specify the
        file name instead of the actual flows list (in the above example, this
        would be 'ntop -F flows.list').


       [1m-K | --enable-debug[0m
        Use this flag to simplify application debug.  It does three things: 1.
        Does not fork() on the "read only" html pages.  2. Displays mutex val-
        ues on  the  configuration  (info.html)  page.   3.  (If  available  -
        glibc/gcc) Activates an automated backtrace on application errors.


       [1m-L | --use-syslog=facility[0m
        Use  this  flag  for  using the syslog instead of stdout.  Please note
        that if ntop (ever) forks a child, regardless  of  this  setting,  the
        syslog  will  be  used for this child.  The (optional) parameter value
        indicates the facility (e.g. daemon, security) to be used for logging,
        using --use-syslog=facility.  [1mThe = is REQUIRED![0m


       [1m-M | --no-interface-merge[0m
        Forces  [1mntop [22mnot to merge network interfaces together. This means that
        [1mntop [22mwill collect statistics for each interface and report them  sepa-
        rately - see Admin | Switch NIC to select which interface to report.

        Note  that the netFlow and sFlow plugins will force the setting of -M.


       [1m-O | --output-packet-path[0m
        Base path for the ntop-suspicious-pkts.XXX.pcap and normal packet  log
        file (in tcpdump format).  If the base path is a directory you have to
        append a / to the string for this to work.


       [1m-P | --db-file-path[0m
        This specifies where [1mntop [22mdb and preferences files are created.

        Note that the default, "." may not be what  you  expect  when  running
        [1mntop  [22mas  a  daemon  or  Win32  service.  Setting an explicit value is
        [1mSTRONGLY [22mrecommended.


       [1m-Q | --spool-file-path[0m
        This specifies where [1mntop [22mspool db files are created. If not specified
        is set to the same value of the db file path (see option above).


       [1m-U | --mapper[0m
        Specifies  the URL of the mapper.pl utility.  [1mntop [22mcreates a hyperlink
        to this URL by appending ?host=xxxxx and creates a  clickable  button.
        Any  type  of  host lookup could be performed, but this is intended to
        lookup the geographical location of the host.

        A cgi-based mapper interface to http://www.multimap.com is part of the
        [1mntop [22mdistribution [see www/Perl/mapper.pl]).


       [1m-V | --version[0m
        Prints [1mntop [22mversion information and then exits.


       [1m-W | --https-server[0m
        If  [1mntop [22mhas been compiled with HTTPS support (via OpenSSL), this flag
        can be used to set the HTTPS port and address.  If the user  specifies
        '-W 0', HTTPS support is disabled.  This is the default (disabled).

        For more information, see the -w parameter above.


       [1m--disable-stopcap[0m
        Return [1mntop [22mto the old (v2.1) behavior on a memory error.  The default
        of stopcap enabled makes  the  web  interface  available  albeit  with
        static content until [1mntop [22mis shutdown.


       [1m--log-extra[0m
        Setting  1  adds  a [file:line] to the beginning of every log message.
        Setting 2 adds a [MSGIDnnnnnnn] tag at the end of every  log  message.
        The nnnnnnn value should be unique number for every message and should
        be stable across [1mntop [22mreleases.  Both are useful for debugging and for
        using log watching and filtering packages.


       [1m--disable-instantsessionpurge[0m
        [1mntop  [22msets  completed  sessions  and  'timed out' and then purges them
        almost instantly, which is not the behavior you might expect from  the
        discussions  about purge timeouts.  This switch makes ntop respect the
        timeouts for completed sessions.  It is NOT the default because a busy
        web server may have 100s or 1000s of completed sessions and this would
        significantly increase the amount of memory [1mntop [22muses.




[1mWEB VIEWS[0m
       While [1mntop [22mis running, multiple users can access the  traffic  informa-
       tion using conventional web browsers.  The main HTML page is divided is
       three frames.  The top frame is a familiar tabbed navigation bar,  con-
       taining  items such as 'Total', 'Sent' and 'IP Protos'.  The left frame
       allows users to select the specific traffic view from among  those  for
       the tab.  The resulting data will be displayed in the right frame.


[1mNOTES[0m
       [1mntop  [22mrequires  a  number of external tools.  Other tools are optional,
       but add to the program's capabilities.


       Required libraries include:

       [1mlibpcap [22mfrom http://www.tcpdump.org/

       The Win32 version makes use of [1mlibpcap for Win32  [22mwhich  may  be  down-
       loaded  from  http://winpcap.polito.it/install/default.htm).   WARNING:
       The 2.x series of [1mlibpcap for  Win32  [22mreleases  will  NOT  support  SMP
       machines.

       [1mgdbm [22mfrom http://www.gnu.org/software/gdbm/gdbm.html

       [1mntop  [22mrequires a POSIX threads library. Although a single-threaded ver-
       sion of [1mntop [22mcan be built from the source if requested during ./config-
       ure, it is not recommended for more than trivial usage.


       Optional libraries include:

       The   [1mgd   [22mlibrary,  for  the  creation  of  gif  files,  available  at
       http://www.boutell.com/gd/. ntop supports both gd 1.X and 2.X

       The [1mlibpng [22mlibrary,  for  the  creation  of  png  files,  available  at
       http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html.

       (if  an  https://  server  is desired) [1mopenSSL [22mfrom the OpenSSL project
       available at http://www.openssl.org.

       The [1mrrdtool [22mis required by the  rrd  plugin  (included  in  the  myrrd/
       directory).   rrdtool creates 'Round-Robin databases' which are used to
       hold and graph historical data.  The rrdtool home page  is  http://peo-
       ple.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/

       The  [1msflow  [22mPlugin  is  courtesy of and supported by InMon Corporation,
       http://www.inmon.com/sflowTools.htm.

       There are other optional libraries.  See the output of ./configure  for
       a fuller listing.

       An  optional tool, which [1mntop [22mwill utilize if available, is [1mlsof [22mavail-
       able from ftp://vic.cc.purdue.edu/pub/tools/unix/lsof/README.

       lsof is used to present a remote view of the open  files  on  the  [1mntop[0m
       host.

       Note  that  lsof  must be configured suid root to enable it's use.  [1mThe[0m
       [1muser is cautioned to fully understand the security implications of this[0m
       [1msetting  before enabling it.  ntop [22mwill function quite properly without
       the lsof tool.

       Tool locations are current as of July  2003  -  please  send  email  to
       report new locations or dead links.
