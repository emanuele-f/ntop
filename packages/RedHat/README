This directory contains the raw files (except for the ones copied
from the normal cvs such as 1STRUN.txt) used to build the rpms
posted at SourceForge.




For reference the rpms are normally built on ur-tigger, which is
a RedHat 7.3+ uml (User Mode Linux) virtual machine running on 
the RedHat 8 machine tigger.

ur-tigger is more properly considered a hybrid 7.3/8 as it
has been updated with numerous packages from RedHat 8
including:

autoconf-2.53-8
automake-1.6.3-1
glibc-2.3.2-4.80
glibc-common-2.3.2-4.80
glibc-devel-2.3.2-4.80
glibc-kernheaders-2.4-7.16
libtool-1.4.2-7
libtool-libs-1.4.2-7

(and their associated and required packages)

Plus RedHat updates to zlib, openssl, et al.
