This directory contains some examples that allow you to 
extract data out of ntop. If you want you can build ntop
as "configure --enable-micro-ntop" if you don't want to 
include the full web interface that's not necessary for
the enclosed code.

Regardless of the used programming language (currently
PHP and Perl are supported) your application can access
two URLs

(1) dumpData.html
http://<ntop host>:<ntop port>/dumpData.html?language=<perl|php>

(2) dumpTrafficData.html
http://<ntop host>:<ntop port>/dumpTrafficData.html?language=<perl|php>

URL (1) will define the %hash array that contains information about 
the active hosts.

URL (2) will define the %interfaces array that contains information about 
the active network interfaces.

Example:
In former ntop versions, users could use the -l flag to periodically
generate a file that contains traffic statistics information. This
functionality has been replaced using this new API.
